            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Happy is that kingdome, family and ſoule, where wiſedome and youth are ſo

            <p>Therefore it is well obſerued, that in buildings God and man do hold a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent courſe; man beginning euer at the foundation, but God at the roofe; he ſtretched out the heauens before he laid the foundation of the world, by his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall workes, giuing vs ſpirituall inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to follow, his order, &amp; euer begin with care of heauenly things: <hi>Seeke firſt the kingdome of God and the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe thereof,</hi>

            <p>Now your highneſſe hauing moſt happily taken your patterne from God, and begun for many yeeres to build from heauen down-wards, making that the corner ſtone: my labour in this little Pro-greſſe is, to bring ſome materials to this worke, and ſhew a method how to bring this goodly building to perfection: that ſeeing it is not my happineſſe as <hi>Paul</hi> to plant, I may bee allowed as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollos</hi> to water thoſe rare and admirable ſeeds of religion and piety already ſowen in your Princely heart.

<pb facs="tcp:14934:5"/>ſweet dew of heauen dropping downe grace into the ſoule, but alſo as ſo many little chinkes by which the heart is kept open that the beames of heauenly knowledge may enter.</p>
            <p>And ſo much the rather is this worke now to be entred vpon, becauſe as the foundation is laid, ſo is the building rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; either ſoone to ruine or for euer to remaine.</p>
            <p>For as the arrow is directed at the firſt, ſo doth it flie all the way, either home, ouer, ſhort, or beſides the marke, ſo that whoſoeuer ſhall make an ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, foreſpeake themſelues as it were at the very firſt.

<pb facs="tcp:14934:13"/>Which we find iuſtly to fall out in ſuch as haue taſted of the waters of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine fountaine, that albeit they exting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſh the deſire of all other things, yet do they ſo worke; that <hi>quo plas ſunt potae, plus ſitiantur aquae,</hi> the more you drinke them, the more you deſire them. And this your Highneſſe wiſdome &amp; induſtry in holy things which all men admire in one of your yeeres &amp; honors, the noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of your birth, &amp; largenes of your glory &amp; fortunes makes more conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous &amp; re-markeable to all men. For as the light of a torch, by how much it is placed in a higher candle-ſticke, by ſo much doth it giue light to more in the roome: ſo vertue and goodneſſe albeit the ſplendor thereof doe euery where ſpread it ſelfe, yet doth it more largely ſend foorth his beames when grafted in a high &amp; emine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t perſon. And it is by the good hand of our God vpon vs, ſo orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in your Princely perſon, aboue the moſt of your ranke in the world, that as gold and ſiluer are apter mettalls to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue pretious ſtones in, then iron or lead, ſo is true nobility, but more truly, the nobleneſſe of your nature, a better ſubiect to imprint any vertue in, then thoſe of a baſer, &amp; lower co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition. For as waxe is apt to receiue al formes, ſo true nobility, and moſt the trueneſſe of your noble nature, is a diſpoſition fitted by the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of God, to receiue the impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:14934:13"/>of any vertue. Therefore God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing done ſo great things for you aboue others, you muſt not content your ſelfe to haue abandoned one vice, or enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained one vertue, but you muſt empty your heart &amp; affections of all the maſſe of corruptions, and fill the cabinet of your ſoule with the rich treaſures and lewels of all manner of vertues. For as one vn-tuned inſtrument deſtroies the whole harmony of muſick, ſo the defect of any one vertue, mars the ſweet har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the ſoule. And as a bird is ſtaid fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> flying away with a little ſtring, yea a ſtrong man in ſwimming is held back by a little twig, and often drownd by a little graſſe growing in the bottom of the riuer: ſo euen the leaſt ſin hinders our paſſage into heauen, as it did <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> from going into <hi>Canaan.</hi> But eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if ſinne grow into cuſtome; for they ſeldom euer riſe that haue the mil-ſton of ill cuſtomes preſſing them downe.</p>
            <p>Therefore, thoſe that would ſafely arriue at the heauenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> muſt ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the two peſts of ill cuſtomes and il companions from them. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a man once begins to like of pleaſure, and to dally with ſinne, ſtraight way as many vanities flocke to him as <hi>Salomon</hi> had concubines. Then he runs ouer reaſon, treads on conſcience, goes by the word, &amp; poſts to deſtruction as if he ran for a kingdom; much like a Larke that retires
<pb facs="tcp:14934:14"/>and falls faſter then ſhee mounted. The Crocodiles egge (they ſay) is at firſt no bigger then a Gooſe egge; but her iſſue growes by little and little till it become eighteen foot long; ſo ſinne at firſt ſeems but a ſmall matter, but once enter and admit him, hee will fill the houſe of the ſoule and prooue a monſter. And as it growes, ſo doth the puniſhment too: an arrow is ſwift, the Sunne is ſwift, but ſin is ſwifteſt of all: for in a moment it is ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned on earth, iudged in heauen, and condemned to hell.</p>
            <p>O that I might once ſee great ones turne ſinne but euen their great ſinnes a begging for want of ſeruice, as good ſeruants often goe a begging for want of maintenance. But I am much afraid, that as God looking downe from heauen to ſee if any would doe good and ſeeke after God, ſaid, <hi>non eſt vnus,</hi> there is not one: So this kind of ſeruing God, to ſhake off om ſinnes, and acquaint our ſelues with God, may goe from Court to country, from City to village, from prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher to hearer, and find none that will ſubſcribe to it. Yet is this required at all our hands vnder paine of eternall dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. For as <hi>Rebecca</hi> had not only eare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of gold, but bracelets too: ſo our armes muſt bee adorned as well as our cares: we muſt not onely haue cares to heare well, and mouthes to ſpeake well, but alſo hands to doe well. And how can
<pb facs="tcp:14934:14"/>that be done, if we giue our ſelues whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the pleaſures of the fleſh? for as moiſt and plaſhy grounds bring foorth nothing but frogs: ſo the belly and watry ſtomacke ſtuft like a tunne, brings forth nothing but foggy thoughts, filthy ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and corrupt affections. Therefore Phyſitians ſay, that nothing is better for the body then abſtinence, Lawyers ſay, nothing is beter for the wits, but diuines ſay nothing is better for the ſoule.</p>
            <p>The ſtory tells vs of a bird, with a mans face, but ſo cruell to man, that it will kill him; yet afterwards ſeeing her owne face in the water, like to that ſhee killed, incontinent kils her ſelfe, becauſe ſhe had killed one like her ſelfe. What then will thoſe men doe, that haue not onely kild one like themſelues, but euen their owne bodies and ſoules, by their ſurfettings, drunkenneſſe, vncleanneſſe, malice, pride, enuy, and other beaſtly intemperancies? O why will we not liue ten yeers, or twenty yeeres like Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; that we might liue not a thouſand, but euen millions of yeeres like Angels? How long ſhall it bee a voice from vs, a ſound to you, and ſo all the matter is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that wee preach or write, all going away like a boy in ones hand, from our bookes and ſermons, remembring and applying nothing that is ſaid or read as the ſtomacke except it haue power of retention makes no benefit of the meat:

For the pleaſures of youth are like gilded pilles, very bitter; like freſh riuers that euer end in the ſea, looſing their ſweete rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh in an ocean of ſaltneſſe.

            <p>I know not how it comes to paſſe that we are afraid to be too holy: &amp; whereas we haue a weight for all kind of mettals, a touch ſtone for golde, and a meaſure for grame, and we wil not take leſſe then meaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But let vs take heede, for as God after twelue moneths came to <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> to take an account of his dreames that he ſent him, ſo will he ſhortly come to euery of vs to take an account of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons we haue heard, the books we haue read, the talents wee haue receiued, the ſtewardſhip committed to vs, and all the holy meanes be hath vſed to winne vs vnto him. Wiſedome, and honour, and greatneſſe, without the ſeare of God will then doe vs no more good, then the Arke did the Philiſtims, procure our greater plagues. And I doubt much though light be come amongſt vs, yet it may truely be ſaid, the Gentils ſit in darkneſſe and the ſhadow of death. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let not our owne gifts or Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit goodnes to vs, in fatuate our harts.

And to aſpire to the future life, wee muſt learne to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne this preſent life; to contemne the preſent, it behooues vs to know it to know it, is to remoue it far from our hearts, and baniſh it from our affections: for the things of this world being ſo neer vs, doe but dazle the minde, and diſtract the iudgement. And theſe <hi>beata otia,</hi> theſe bleſſed times of peaces, theſe gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſeaſons of the Goſpell can no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be continued to vs, but by caſhie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the vanities of the world and graſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of heauen.

            <p>The way to doe this, is euer to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare on the laſt date of our dayes, when
<pb facs="tcp:14934:16"/>we ſhal come to that great audit to giue an account of all we haue done in the fleſh: for the very thought of death is as a ſtrainer cleanſing and purging al our thoughts, words and actions, like a cloth that hath been many times poſſed and plunged in the water. And the rather is this meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> proſitable, becauſe death comes ſudde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly as a meſſenger vn lookt for. Who would haue thought the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſhold haue entred <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> ſo ſoon, and made ſuch a ſudden and wofull ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uock neuer to be recouered? who would haue thought that <hi>Herod</hi> ſhould ſo ſoon haue beene eaten with lice, when the people cried, the voice of God and not of man?

<pb facs="tcp:14934:17"/>that made them ſo rich and glorious. Therfore this <hi>Morieris,</hi> thou ſhalt die, is an excellent Motto, for all great ones eſpecially, it is like a barre in their armes, it will make the proudeſt vaile &amp; fall his creaſt.</p>
            <p>But what need ſo many words to ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, iudicious, &amp; well ſeaſoned a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I know to be of the reſolution of that euer memorable <hi>Alphonſus</hi> King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> who being highly praiſed for his nobility, in that he was <hi>rex, regis fili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, regis nepos, regis frater:</hi> a King, a Kings ſonne, a Kings nephew, and a Kings bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: anſwered, I eſteeme nothing leſſe in this life, then theſe vanities, for theſe are not my commendations, but rather theirs who by their valour and vertues, righteouſnes, te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perance, prudence &amp; the like, haue gotten me theſe kingdoms &amp; honors: nor are kingdomes any thing to the ſucceſſors but burdens; and then only become honours if they be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued rather for their vertues, then by te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament and ſucceſſion. This is that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that can make a man truely noble, both in this life &amp; in a better. Therfore <hi>Maximilian</hi> anſwered one well, ſuing to him for letters Patents to ennoble him: that it was in this power to make him rich, but only vertue could make him noble. And as all, but chieſly thoſe that owe God moſt, hauing receiued moſt, muſt ſhu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the world &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:14934:17"/>all ill cuſtoms, ſo muſt they be careful to auoide ill company. And to this end, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to ſuffer <hi>Dauids</hi> proteſtation and practiſe in a whole Pſalme depart out of their hearts.<note place="margin">Pſal. 101.</note> For as it is great wiſedome not onely to ſhun the plague, but euen euery ragge that may ſeeme to carry the plague with it: ſo it is heauenly wiſedom not only to auoid groſſe and fowle ſinnes and ſinners, but euen all the peccadilia dwarſe-ſinnes, and all thoſe ſine mincers of ſinne. For as it is policy not to goe ſo neere the riuers banke as we can for feare of falling in: ſo it is heauenly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion not to come neere ſinne, nor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant wicked perſons that are not ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with the true knowledge of God, the ſonnes of <hi>Belial:</hi> corrupt men and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, concerning the faith; enemies of the Croſſe of Chriſt, whoſe belly is their God, whoſe end is damnation, whoſe glory is to their ſhame, which minde earthly things, for feare wee bee ouer-taken and infected before wee bee aware. For one ſinner deſtroieth much good,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 9.18.</note> nay the breath of a wicked perſon is euen bainfull to the company. Nor let them euer thinke that ſuch a companion or ſuch a ſeruant as is not the true ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of God,<note place="margin">Suidas.</note> can euer bee faithfull to them. For as the Hiſtorian reports, when one changed his religion to pleaſe the King, hee was iudged to looſe his head, and one appointed to cry at his execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:14934:18"/>He that keepes not faith towards God, what ſound conſcience can he haue towards men? therefore in euery great houſe there would bee prouiſion of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms and wings to ſweep downe the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders webs, &amp; ſo by leauing them no place nor meanes to hurt the harmleſſe ſlies, the Spider it ſelfe might at laſt be quite ſwept our too. Nor let them thinke that becauſe they are great, they may vſe what cuſtoms, companions, and ſeruants they pleaſe: For as <hi>Alexander</hi> to a City of <hi>Aſia,</hi> that offered him halfe their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to deſiſt from war, anſwered, I came not into <hi>Aſia</hi> with a purpoſe to take what you would giue me, but that you ſhould retain what I would leaue you: ſo faith God to them; I came not into your houſes or kingdomes, or ſoules, that you ſhould condition with me what I ſhould ſuffer you to doe, and to liue as you liſt; and to take ſuch conditions of you as you would giue me, at your pleaſure; but that what conditions I haue thought fit to require of you, you ſhould accept them, and thinke them beſt and moſt happy. For God is our <hi>ſummum bonum,</hi> wee muſt not reſt below him, not yet reach aboue him; below him is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous neglect, aboue him is damnable preſumption. Therefore muſt wee not loue God forour owne profit or pleaſure, which is the ſoule-killing cuſtome of moſt in the world; for ſuch a one is like a
<pb facs="tcp:14934:18"/>child that faith his prayers that he may haue his break-faſt. But we muſt loue him how-ſoeuer it fare with vs, with-out any reſpect of our owne good, becauſe he only is worthy of our loue, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is worthy of it but he, and in his loue conſiſts all our happineſſe.</p>
            <p>I ſay there is great need therefore of the practiſe of this art of ſeruing God, as this ſhort pro-greſſe ſets it out; ſeeing it brings vs not only within the view of the heauenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> but euen into the boſome and communion of his loue. And ſeeing alſo we liue in the dregs of time, wherein it is come to paſſe, that as the waters couered the whole earth, ſo pride and other monſtrous impieties hath couered it againe, and not ſuffered eight perſons to eſcape. For doe we not ſee the City of God, the holy profeſſion of Ieſus Chriſt, to bee deſtitute of walls, gates, and guards, and the repaire of it either hindered by ſects of men madly furious, or elſe oppugned by the craft and cunning, &amp; violent aſſaults of men either meerely epicures, or ſottedly ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious? on the one ſide Chriſt Ieſus is vtterly caſt off by the luſt of theſe moſt impure hogs that are euer wallowing in the myre, on the other ſide the riches &amp; eſtate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>For though <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> bee dead, yet his pride is come amongſt vs; though <hi>Sodom</hi> be burnt to duſt and aſhes, yet are her ſinnes remaining (if not raigning) with vs: though <hi>Symon Magus</hi> be gone, yet hath he left the ſtaine of ſymony in the higheſt degree to vs: though <hi>Iezabel</hi> be dead, yet doe bribes liue and thriue, and beare away the bell in all buſineſſe: and men begin to take courage to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any ſinne by example. For when the pillars ſinke the Temple falls; when a great tree is hewen downe, which is a ſhade to the beaſts, and a reſt to the

For if we call to mind thoſe heauenly, ſecret, and wonderfull myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of our ſaluation, alſo thoſe things by which all mankind is either much furthered, or greatly hindered in the way to heauen: to conclude, if we call to minde thoſe things which aſwell the Church of God, as kingdomes &amp; ſtates ſtand as much need of vs as the world doth of fire and water: wee muſt needs confeſſe, that in this Pro-greſſe are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed moſt excellent, neceſſary, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable things of all men to bee knowne and obſerued. How great a benefit the diligent reading thereof may bring to all ſorts, accommodating and directing all things therein to the vſe of true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and increaſe of holy life, the due conſideration of the parts, and true pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of the paſſages thereof will ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently declare.

            <p>Now for as much as the world is po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered with a kind of people reſembling ſeruants and men of low condition, who expecting in the lobbies and out-rooms their maſters comming, and being idle and brainleſſe how to beſtow their time well, do take a coale and with fond and filthy phraſes, be-ſincare the faire pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Firſt, the chiefeſt and higheſt end of Preaching and Hearing Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons is,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that all glory and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour may bee attributed from men vnto God, both in this world, and in the world to come; which glory conſiſts in the true and right knowledge of God, and in the true inward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward worſhip of God, ſo truely knowne.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the meane ſcope and end, leading and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting to this high end, are theſe.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, the eternall ſaluation
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:14934:50"/>of mans ſoule and body, with which is ioyned this temporary life both in proſperity and aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, for that God may of vs bee glorified; and not (as it commeth to paſſe in this world by Sathan and his members) bee affected with contumely and ignominy, by infidelity and impiety: it is neceſſary, that it be well with vs, and that wee bee aſſured of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, and that from God the Father by the deliuerance of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and the working of the holy Spirit: For who <hi>in the graue will praiſe thee,</hi> ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.

Fourthly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> that wee may flee incredulity and vices, and giue our ſelues to the ſtudy of faith and vertues, it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that we hate and deteſt them, and loue and embrace theſe: and therefore the drift of all Sermons is, that the minde, and heart and conſcience of the hearer may bee inflamed to them both. Fiftly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> that the minde and ſoule of the hearer, may bee inflamed to the hatred and eſchewing of ſin and wickedneſſe, and to the loue, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication and practiſe of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, it is neceſſarily required, that the euill of incredulity and vices, and alſo the good of faith

Thirdly, the loweſt driſt of hearing Sermons,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting by theſe meanes vnto the higheſt end, is that the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the hearer, by the grace of Gods holy Spirit, may bee by Sermons informed in the faith, and errours about the ſame: in vertues, and the vices deſtroying them.

3 The third neceſſary duty to come to the right ſcope and drift of hearing Sermons, is, that the hearer haue a right and holy affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of heart, towards the things vnderſtood: for many do heare and vnderſtand Sermons, who are yet nothing affected with them; nor truely and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected towards them.

And ſurely not without great cauſe ought our hearts to bee rightly and holily affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the things vnderſtood, in regard of the ſundry ſorts of men, who heare and vnderſtand Sermons, but yet ſtand nothing
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:14934:69"/>well affected towards them. Firſt, there are ſome men,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> who, euen at the Sermon, doe giue very eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent argument, either by their words or behauiours, that they are the manifeſt enemies of truth and vertue, and the friends of falſhood and vices: Theſe mens affections towards the Word are nothing right.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, there are certaine hypocrites, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit by their words and geſtures make a faire ſhew of the loue of truth and goodneſſe, and the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of falſhood and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, yet their heart is not vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right. Thirdly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> others do thinke that if they carry the truth and vertue hid in their hearts, albeit in word and deed they carry themſelues otherwiſe, that they cannot bee accuſed of the vn-vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe and prauity of their hearts: but theſe haue not a right hart.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, there are ſome that albeit they vnderſtand not ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and fully the things heard, yet are angry with the true and good

Fifthly, ſome,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> on the other ſide, albeit they do ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know the things they heare, inſomuch that they can ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt it: yet haue things falſe and euill taken ſuch deepe roote in them, and ſo preuailed, by the long cuſtome they haue had with them, that they had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther quite forſake that which is true and good, then caſt away their inueterate and ancient er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and manners: and who can ſay that theſe men haue a right affection?

               <p>It is a thing moſt vndoubted that the vſe and application of the doctrines wee heere deliuer are of ſingular benefite to the hearer: For without due vſe and application, the beſt Sermons that euer were, are but dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: Seeing theſe two, Vſe and Application, are the very life and motion of Sermons, for more full declaration thereof, let vs briefly obſerue, that Doctrines, Vſes and Application, are as the tree, the fruite, and the gathering of the fruite; as the medicine the vertue of it, and the application, as money, the value of it, and the

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3 From this duty of applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the hearer can by no meanes be excluded; For hee is, by the working of the Holy Ghoſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the good pleaſure of God, to apply vnto himſelfe the doctrines and vſes deliuered by the Preacher: Seeing the Holy
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:14934:78"/>Ghoſt vſeth the hearer as his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, to beginne and perfect his owne worke in him; which holy duety the hearer is to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme to himſelfe, both at the Sermon, and alſo after Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon: At the Sermon, whilſt the hearer by the benefite and motion of the holy Spirit apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, eſpecially to himſelfe, all thoſe things which in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall were deliuered by the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher to the whole Aſſembly: And after Sermon hee is alſo to make the like application both publiquely and priuately: Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely, whilſt with a ioyfull thankeſ-giuing, together with the Preacher and the Aſſembly, hee prayſeth the name of God, for his ſingular and in eſtimable fauour of the reuelation of his ſauing truth vnto him, and by ſerious and ardent ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on intreate of God, that by the working of his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, hee would bee pleaſed to bring to paſſe, that the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines

               <p>But beſides, the hearer muſt priuately apply vnto himſelfe the doctrines with the vſe, in euery condition of life, as well in aduerſe as proſperous times, and that both before, amongſt, and after all his actions: But chiefly when any perplexed ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or intricate queſtions are obiected vnto vs, either by others, or by our owne fleſh: But chiefly when Satan ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities vs by his Stratagemes, ſleights and grieuous tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to errours in the ſaith or life, that is, to hereſies and ſins: whilſt he endeuours to bring to paſſe, that either wee doe not at all regard the good of vertue, or elſe performe it not lawfully, or at the leaſt not

               <p n="2">2 Hauing ſhewed that God, the Preacher,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and alſo the Hearer himſelfe, muſt all concurre in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the doctrines and vſes, we muſt now ſee how, and by what meanes this application is to bee made. In the meanes and manner of application which muſt bee made of the hearer, two things are chiefly to be obſerued: Firſt, what things are to bee eſchewed as enemies to this application:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Secondly, what things are to bee embraced as helpes vnto it:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> In which two points are thoſe other two parts formerly obſerved in handling this matter of applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion contained, which I called the impediments and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancements of application, and follow to bee ſpoken of in the third and fourth places.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The impediments of appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation which are to bee abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:14934:79"/>being ſuch as hinder the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of Preaching, and cauſe both doctrines and vſes to bee abuſed, are, Firſt, that vulgar, but moſt pernicious opinion, that it ſufficeth to heare the word of God, to vnderſtand it, and with a tranſitory ſenſe of the fruite and profite thereof to bee affected: albeit the practiſe of it bee not extended through our whole liues. This dangerous conceite is ſtrongly ſhaken and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne by our Sauiour in the parable of the Seed,<note place="margin">Mat. 13.19 20.21.22.</note> which falling in three ſorts of ground, namely, by the way ſide, in ſtony and thorny ground, was caught away choakt and withered, and all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was no application: And no leſſe ſweetly cheecked and branded with the note of deceiuing themſelues, is the ſame opinion by the bleſſed Apoſtle.<note place="margin">Iam. 1.22.23 24.</note> But aboue all, that fearefull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of Chriſt is not to bee forgotten:<note place="margin">Luk. 12.47</note> That ſeruant that knew his Maiſters will, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:14934:80"/>by which meanes application is much hindred, as wee may ſee in thoſe. Gueſts that being bidden to the Supper,<note place="margin">Luk. 16.14</note> excuſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues by their ſeuerall employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſeeing a Farme, marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a wife, and trying two yoake of Oxen. Fourthly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> raſhneſſe and ruſhing into buſineſſe, is a great enomy to application; namely, when men thruſt themſelues into the handling of buſineſſes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any cenſure or tryall of their liues, counſels, words and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to the touch-ſtone of the doctrines contained in the word. Fifthly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> the horrible carnall ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the greateſt part of the world, running vpon their owne deſtruction, euen in the entrance, hinders much the application; for heere hath Satan a wiſhed occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſowing his Tares. Sixth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the too much care of this life, of the belly and pleaſures, whilſt in the meane time, not onely the generall care which all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ought to haue, but alſo the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:14934:81"/>ſpeciall care which concernes euery man in his place and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, is neglected: And this is not the leaſt impediment of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, and therefore wee muſt labour by Gods grace to take this out of the way, that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly doctrine may finde place. Seuenthly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> 
                  <hi>opus operatum,</hi> is not the leaſt poyſon of application; to wit, a conceite wherewith ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny falſely perſwade themſelues, that it ſufficeth to bee Baptized, at certaine times to frequent the Temple, for an houre to heare a Sermon, which happily may ſtrike the eare, but neuer wound the conſcience; and happily ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with others receiue the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Communion, and performe ſuch other outward rites and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies; but yet without all vnderſtanding, or inward moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the heart, or amendment of their liues.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Eightly, the vaine hope of a longer life makes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſlow in applying the moſt profitable doctrines: for they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:14934:81"/>that albeit for the preſent, they omit and neglect the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; yet there remaines a great part of their time behind, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they will expreſſe the doctrine in their liues: And if they chance to fall into any diſeaſe, or bee brought neere death, that then it will bee a fit time to performe theſe things. Ninthly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> the euill examples of ſuch as do daily, but ſecurely contemne the word of God, doe hinder and diſturbe many from applying the doctrine to themſelues:<note place="margin">Eccl. 8.11</note> For, <hi>Becauſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence against an euill worke is not executed ſpeedily, therefore the heart of the ſonnes of men is fully ſet in them to doe euill.</hi> Tenthly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable hypocriſie of thoſe men that with an externall viſard of piety, do ſet vpon men, and giue a goodly ſhew of goodneſſe, like painted wals, and whited Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres, ſuch as were the Phariſes, but eſpecially hee that was not like other men, and ſcorned the Publican in reſpect of himſelfe.<note place="margin">Luke 18.</note>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:14934:82"/>Eleuenthly, this Diabolicall ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageme of Satan in making men beleeue, that they may ſerue two Maiſters,<note place="margin">Math. 6.9 10.11.12</note> God and the world, God and the fleſh, againſt the manifeſt truth of our Sauiours owne mouth, doth alſo preuaile with many men, who would not ſeeme to be altogether Atheiſts, not to make any application to themſelues of the good things they heare.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> Twelfthly, alſo feare of the croſſe and perſecution, with-draw many from the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the heauenly doctrine of Chriſt: for the fleſh and the deuill obiect, that if thou in thy life ſhalt profeſſe the knowne truth, thou ſhalt caſt thy ſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to manifeſt danger of life and goods.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> Thirteenthly, nay both Scripture and experience doe teach vs, that ſome are growne to that madneſſe and malice, as not to bee aſhamed,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.1.</note> to draw the moſt profitable doctrine of Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Word into an occaſion of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Theſe Impediments and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:14934:82"/>Lets, the Preacher muſt not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet forth in his Sermons and conferences, but alſo the Hearers muſt with all care and diligence obſerue and ſhunne them, as the maine peſts of application.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4 Thus hauing runne ouer ſuch things as the hearer is chiefly to abandon, except in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the holy doctrine of Chriſt, hee will caſt himſelfe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſnare and ſtumbling blocke, I will in few words teach where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this ſoule-ſauing applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conſiſts, that the ſincere Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors may know how to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe themſelues therein with a holy endeuour: Therefore, firſt,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> wee muſt know, that the very beginning of all application, is a ſerious and fixed purpoſe that the Hearer hath, of what condition ſoeuer hee bee, that hee will by the grace and helpe of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, conforme himſelfe, and all his internall and externall actions, at all times, as well in proſperity as aduerſity, according to the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:14934:83"/>doctrines in the Word of God propoſed.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, ſeeing our nature after the fall of our firſt parents, is ſo depraued, that it neuer agrees with the will of God in the ſacred Word reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the Hearer muſt certainely reſolue with himſelfe, that there is no other way of application, but that both in his entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Schoole of Chriſt, and in his progreſſe thorow it, hee deny himſelfe, ſeeing Chriſt hath ſo admoniſhed before hand: <hi>Hee that will bee my Diſciple, let him take vp his croſſe, deny himſelfe and follow mee:</hi> For application muſt begin at the mortification of the old man, and it muſt end at the quickning of the new man. Thirdly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> it is not the laſt, nor leaſt part of application, to haue, and ſenſibly to feele the combat betwixt the Old and New man, the Fleſh and the Spirit, which all the faithfull ſeruants of God in this world muſt haue in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: In which conflict and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:14934:83"/>combate of the fleſh and Spirit, the regenerate part, by the power of God, doth euer ouercome the vn-regenerate, through the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of ſuch doctrines as are in Sermons handled out of the ſacred Scripture. Fourthly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> to the application of Doctrines and V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes this is further required, that the Hearer doe order and direct the ordinary cenſure and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſometimes the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, of all his life, and the whole actions thereof, according to thoſe doctrines; making thoſe heauenly doctrines the ſquare and rule by which to examine his whole life. This is a ſingular part of application.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 5. Theſe holy enſuing effects will neceſſarily follow the cenſure and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation which euery faithfull hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer ſhall make of himſelfe; for in them the power of application doth wonderfully ſhew it ſelfe: for this probation and examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our liues and all our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, being vſed, will in part ſhew
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:14934:84"/>that there is ſome congruity with the will of God reuealed in his Word, and that hee hath labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſomething to apply vnto himſelfe the heauenly doctrine, and to conforme the actions of his life vnto it. This will alſo ſtir vp in him thankefulneſſe for the benefite of application, freely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on him, by the working and motion of the Holy Ghoſt; and alſo it will ſtirre him vp to prayer, that there may bee gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him the continuance of ſo great a benefite, and that at laſt it may come to perfection in him. And whilſt on the other ſide hee ſhall behold a diſcrepan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and diſ-agreement of his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the doctrines which are often out of the word of God repeated, and that the applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them is lame and imperfect, there will begin to ariſe in him, a certaine godly and health-giuing ſorrow for his neglect, and an humble deprecation vnto God to keepe him from the euils enſuing
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:14934:84"/>ſuch lame and in-ſufficient appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Sixthly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> to conclude, if the Hearer do vnderſtand by the word of God, and his often cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and examinations, that ſin doth cleaue to all the children of God as long as they are in this world, and that none of their actions are in euery reſpect pure and perfect; his heart will bee inflamed with a holy deſire of his heauenly Countrey, and of the glory there prepared for the ſonnes of God, where there ſhall bee a full and moſt perfect appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and congruity of our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with the will and pleaſure of God. And theſe things which I haue ſpoken of the application which euery Hearer is to make of the doctrines and vſes propoſed out of Gods word, are ſuch as muſt be conſpicuous and euident through his whole life, and all the actions thereof.</p>

               <p n="1">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1 This cenſure and viſitation that I ſpeake of, it is nothing elſe but an examination and proofe of the actions of the Preacher and Hearer, which conſiſts in theſe two things:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> firſt, that they haue a reſpect to the rule of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in this Treatiſe deſcribed, or ſuch like, drawne from the word of God:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſecondly, that there be an aduiſed obſeruation and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition ſet downe, whether the actions of the Preacher and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer bee conforme to that rule of God: Now the actions of which the cenſure and examination muſt paſſe, are either ſuch as haue reſpect to the Sermon it ſelfe, namely, how the Preacher doth teach, and the Hearer learne, or to the fruite and benefite ariſing from Sermons, as well in the life of the Preacher as of the Hearer: as well the common fruite which
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:14934:92"/>is required of euery Chriſtian, as thoſe more proper, required of euery man in his Office and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Now thoſe that are to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and examine the actions and liues both of Preachers and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers are in a double difference:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> For firſt, this cenſure,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> iudgement and triall of mens liues is to bee made by men: ſecondly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> when they faile, it is certaine God will neuer bawke nor faile to cenſure, and that ſoundly, and hee is the ſecond Cenſurer. Firſt, man is the cenſurer,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> for hee is Gods agent to bring himſelfe and others to glory. Now men doe cenſure, as you know, either pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickely or priuately: and the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate cenſure is either done by the Preacher or Hearer; the Preacher may and ought to cenſure both himſelfe and his Hearer: himſelfe, whether hee Preach according to the true Rule, and liue according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſo ſeale the doctrine that hee Preacheth: the Hearer hee
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:14934:93"/>cenſures, namely, how hee learnes, and liues according to that hee learnes: But for the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer his cenſure is directed, either to the Miniſter to himſelfe, or others, for of all theſe is hee the cenſurer: to enquire and enforme himſelfe, whether the Preacher himſelfe or others, doe Preach, heare and practiſe as becomes eueryone of them in their ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall places and callings: and this hee muſt doe, not onely, that God bleſſing our endeuours, wee may bee by our ſelues amended; but alſo that mutuall and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable admonitions may be vſed to the common edification of all. And this is all I will ſay concerning this priuate cenſure and examination: onely this I will beg of God, that hee will giue ſuch a meaſure of grace to all, both Preachers and Hearers, that they may haue more and more, regard of this cenſure: for the omiſſion of it, or the not dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently regarding of it, is the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:14934:93"/>cauſe why many, and that moſt, heauenly Sermons do paſſe away without fruite or comfort, as too too manifeſt experience in euery part of this Kingdome ſheweth.</p>
               <p>Now the Publicke Cenſure and Examination, both of Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and Hearers is either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Church and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall perſons, or to the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick and Ciuill Gouernours: the Eccleſiaſticall cenſure which is ordered by Eccleſiaſticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the Ciuill Magiſtrates, or perſons ſometimes aſſiſting them: is firſt exerciſed in the conuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made by the Miniſter of euery ſeuerall Church: Secondly, in Claſſicke and approued Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods and ſpeciall Viſitations, where the cenſure is made by the Viſitors and Miniſters of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches adioyning, and other Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Officers, not onely concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Hearers, but alſo Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, Church-wardens, diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buters of Almes, Teachers of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:14934:94"/>Schoole and their Scholers: Thirdly, in generall Viſitations and Synodes by Eccleſiaſticall perſons alone, and this is the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall cenſure. But the Politicall cenſure is that which is done by Politicall perſons: as, firſt, in the conuentions of ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Cities, Streetes and Villages, where an account is taken of euery man by certaine Sworne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men how they leade their liues: ſecondly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in the yearely conuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, where calling together the Maiſter of euery family in the Dioceſſe, an inquiſition is made by the rulers concerning the liues of thoſe Sworne-men, and men of a lower Office then is the head Magiſtrate, whether they bee conformable to the lawes or no:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> thirdly, when there is a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and inquiſition by men of greater power, of, and concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all Officers, Sworne-men and other Subiects. And hence may it appeare, that there is a moſt ſweete harmony and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:14934:94"/>betwixt the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and Politicall cenſures and gouernements, none of them hindring one another, but rather giuing each one another, mutuall helpe.</p>
               <p>Yea, if wee reſpect the effects of both theſe cenſures wee ſhall finde in them an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent proportion: For thoſe that are found in this cenſure to bee endued with ſingular gifts, and to liue agreeably to the Word of GOD, and the Lawes, whether they bee Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers or Hearers, are not onely for the promotion of Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the publicke and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate ſaluation both of body and ſoule to be commended, but alſo to bee preferred to greater Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Places: But ſeeing of thoſe Preachers and Hearers who liue not agreeably to the Word of GOD, and the Lawes, there are certaine degrees; they muſt bee dealt withall according to the quality
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:14934:95"/>of the offence: and heere wee muſt obſerue that both the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall and Politicall cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures haue their certaine degrees and diſtinct orders of puniſhing offenders, wherein the ſaid two cenſures doe moſt ſwee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:14934:95"/>debarring and excluding them from entrance into the Church; which anſweres to the excluſion &amp; baniſhment Politicall. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet if not by this meanes hee can bee bridoled, then the laſt remedy is to bee miniſtred, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, excommunication, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with being cut off from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Church, hee is deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto Satan, and this anſweres to the capitall puniſhment of death by the Magiſtrate.

All theſe cenſures, if they were ſeriouſly, carefully and lawfully extended, and practiſed, againſt

Therefore the miſeries and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that befall particular men, and whole Kingdomes, for the neglect of theſe cenſures come now to bee conſidered: Let vs behold them in a three-fold moſt grieuous kind of ſingular puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: 1.

To the happy lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this holy Art, there are two Schoole-maiſters very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary: Firſt,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the holy Spirit of God; for if all good gifts come from aboue, much more this moſt excellent grace of holy Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and therefore with moſt inſtant and humble prayer is this gift to bee ſought for at Gods hands:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the practiſe of Meditation, for by it, as are all other Arts, ſo is that acquired; for as hee who ſeldome or neuer writes, ſhall neuer write perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo hee that ſeldome or neuer Meditates ſhall neuer come to the perfect vſe and vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Meditation.</p>
               <p>But beſides, that wee may not faile in ſetting downe a right courſe of Meditation, two things are to bee conſidered: namely, the Method and Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>er of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation:
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:14934:107"/>for it is very fit that we know before-hand, as well the manner how to meditate, as the matter and obiect about which our minde is to bee employed; elſe the want of either of theſe may ſo hinder our proceedings, that wee ſhall not bee able either to beſtow our minds in this holy exerciſe, or to continue in it with that benefite which is to bee expected from it. And this exerciſe comes very neere the nature of prayer, if wee define prayer,<note place="margin">Chryſ.</note> as ſome of the Fathers haue done, to bee a colloquy and ſpeech with God; or an aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the minde towards God:<note place="margin">Damaſ.</note> for Meditation generally ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies all the inward acts of the underſtanding, will, and other powers of the ſoule, when they are directed to God, and things aboue.</p>
               <p>And indeed, Meditation is nothing elſe but a diſcourſe of the underſtanding, and ſtudious intention of the minde, diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:14934:108"/>inſiſting about the finding out of ſomething, I ſay of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, either exhorting vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that which is good, or diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vs from that which is euill: and ſo weighing and digeſting the godly things wee heare or reade to the worke of prayer, euen as the foode whereby the will is fed and made ſtrong, and for this cauſe the manner of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation is to bee framed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the worke of our will; namely, that Meditation may be vſed as an inſtrument whereby the will may bee affected with that, and vnto that, which is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and good; and for that cauſe may neither make too much haſt, nor yet bee too ſlow, but onely may in ſuch a ſort bee exerciſed, as may beſt ſerue the heart, that when the will becomes inflamed it may bee interrupted, vntill that heate being well allayed, it bee fit to fall to it againe; for more labour muſt bee beſtowed vpon the affection then the meditation
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:14934:108"/>it ſelfe, inſomuch that by how much the meditation is ſhorter, by ſo much is the prayer more happy, being made fruitfull by the affection multiplyed vpon it.</p>
               <p>In a word, that wee may come to ſpeake of the matter and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of meditation as wee haue propoſed, this firſt vnderſtand: that meditation is in two ſorts performed: firſt, when we medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate of things which may bee perceiued by the ſenſes, vnder corporall repreſentations, as of the actes of Chriſts Paſſion: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, or of things intellectuall, as of the goodneſſe and excellent beauty of God, which albeit they may bee conceiued vnder ſome corporall imaginations, yet they doe not properly require it; but the whole thing it ſelfe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the helpe of any repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is done by the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. And according to theſe two manners of meditation, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God is diſtinguiſhed: firſt, an imaginary preſence, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:14934:109"/>to the firſt kinde of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation: ſecondly, an intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all preſence, according to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond kinde. Now the preſence of God is a certaine application of the minde and affection, to God and heauenly things, conceiued either after an imaginary or intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuall manner; which applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is moſt neceſſary in all our Meditations.</p>
               <p>Now come we to ſhew thoſe two things, which I ſaid before were principall helpes to thoſe that would meditate aright, and thoſe are the matter and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode or forme of meditation.</p>

               <p>Beſides, thou maiſt often me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate to what end this noble Creature Man, and this glorious frame of the world was made: for that is the foundation of all our ſaluation and perfection: and that it ſhall not heerein bee amiſſe to follow the wiſedome and direction of our Church, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in her ſteps for our helpe in this godly exerciſe: This wee ſhall doe, if on the ſolemne daies of prayer and holy exerciſes, wee ſhall diligently weigh with our ſelues, ſuch Myſteries of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion as are on thoſe daies propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to bee reade and expounded to the people: If on the Feaſts of the Saints of God, we reuolue in our mindes, their liues, deaths, vertues, and memorable actes, together with the glory they haue now happily attained. If vpon the Aduents of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt wee ſhall duely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:14934:110"/>the Myſteries of his holy Incarnation and Natiuity: If in, and during the Lent, wee ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly meditate on the holy Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels appointed to bee reade dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: If vpon the Lords day, wee conſider with our ſelues the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of our Lord and Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Ieſus Chriſt, or the generall reſurrection of all men, and the happineſſe which thoſe that die in the Lord ſhall attaine vnto, which the Lords day doth repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent vnto vs; or the benefites of God, or the Goſpell of that day: or doe ſo diſpoſe of theſe foure points, that euery month, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining foure Lords dayes, wee at once performe theſe, allotting vnto euery Lords day theſe ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall points. If alſo on ſuch daies wherein wee receiue the holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lords Supper, wee enter into diligent medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Myſteries of that heauenly Sacrament, or of the paſſion and death of the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, whereof that was inſtituted a

               <p>And let vs know this withall, that euery Chriſtian ought very often to handle and meditate on that vertue which hee knowes himſelfe to ſtand moſt in need of; and on that vice which he chiefly deſires to haue extinguiſhed in himſelfe: for as the body doth more deſiringly ſeeke after, and more profitably and readily digeſt thoſe meats which are moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and agreeable to the palate and taſte; in like manner the ſoule ſhould more frequently meditate, and as it were feed it ſelfe with thoſe things which are to it more taſtefull &amp; profitable: for I am ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:14934:111"/>perfwaded that the rule of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions is as true in ſpiritual things as in coporall: <hi>quod ſapit, nutrit,</hi> That which is ſauory to the taſte is nouriſhing to the ſtomacke.</p>
               <p>Onely to end this point, let theſe three things be obſerued in the matter of Meditation: firſt, that great care bee vſed in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of euery week or month, in preparing of fit and ſufficient matter of meditation which may ſerue for that whole time: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if it ſo fall out any day, that iuſt occaſion of changing our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed matter of meditation be offered, as Sermons, or ſolemne exerciſes of prayer, and the like, then wee muſt deferre the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of that day vntill the next day following: thirdly, albeit there is much benefite ariſing from a ſetled courſe of prefixing to our ſelues certaine matters to bee meditated on, from weeke to weeke, and month to month, yet may euery one meditate on other matters in one &amp; the ſame
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:14934:112"/>day; and becauſe theſe few mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of meditation following, ſeeme to bee more profitable and neceſſary to euery Chriſtian then the reſt, euery Chriſtian may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides other matters of medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, take euery weeke theſe in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der into his meditation: namely, firſt, to meditate on Monday vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on death; ſecondly, on Tueſday, vpon the laſt iudgement; thirdly, on Wedneſday, vpon the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of hell; fourthly, on Thurſeday vpon the glory of heauen; fifthly, on Friday vpon the Paſſion of Chriſt; ſixthly, on Saturday vpon his ſinnes; and ſeuenthly on the Lords day, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the benefites of God beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Man-kinde.</p>

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:14934:147"/>and vſe of this methode: And I will heerein obſerue theſe three points; firſt, the things which ought to goe before our medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; ſecondly, that accompany them; thirdly, that follow them.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For as much as euery man may perſwade himſelfe that how much more diligently hee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerues theſe inſtructions, ſo much more happy ſucceſſe hee ſhall finde in his meditations, they muſt the more carefully bee hee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and obſerued. The firſt thing then is, that there bee a diligent preparation made to meditation: For if wee will not preſume to ſpeake to a King without many aduiſements taken with our ſelues how to frame our tales, much leſſe may wee dare to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe our ſelues to ſo great a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty without due regard had of our proceeding. This preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then conſiſts in theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing points.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, we muſt know the Hiſtory, or Myſterie of our ſaluation, vpon which wee pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:14934:148"/>to meditate, together with the circumſtances, place, time, perſons, and other appurtenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: for the knowledge of the fact, is the foundation of medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>Ergo,</hi> good it is to reade the Text, or to bring it to freſh memory.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the matter of meditation thus had, it muſt bee diſtinguiſht into certaine conſiderations, that euery thing may come in his order; and that done, wee muſt prepare certaine pre-paſſages and colloquies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the meditation, of which heereafter.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, wee muſt beware that wee come not to meditate when the body is wearied, or the ſpirit is heauy, as it oft fals out after too much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or writing; but a good while before meditation to leaue all, that with more ſtrength of body and ſpirit wee may come to it.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, a good while before the meditation, if the time will giue leaue, either in the morning, or euening before we go to bed,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:14934:148"/>the points of our meditation are diligently to be looked ouer, and committed to memory; and one may take a paper containing the points to bee meditated, and lay before him for memories ſake. Fifthly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> going to bed hee muſt briefly call to minde the ſame points, and in the morning of the day following conſecrate his firſt thoughts to God, and whilſt hee is dreſſing himſelfe; either with heart or mouth offer vnto God prayer and prayſes, that hee may amongſt the firſt exerciſes of his deuotion call to minde the points of the meditation which hee is that day to make, and may ſtirre vp in himſelfe a feruent deſire of doing the ſame aright. Sixthly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> a little before his meditation let him remember, that as our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our willes all, before they pray to go into their chamber and ſhut the dore; ſo hee muſt enter into himſelfe, ſhutting the dore of his heart againſt all othor thoughts and worldly imployments, and
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:14934:149"/>conſidering with himſelfe what it is that hee is to doe, and to what end.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Seuenthly, it will much helpe the fruite of medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to come to it with an appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite and inflamed deſire of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating, to which purpoſe hee muſt vſe the meanes to prouoke his appetite. For as thoſe that haue no ſtomacke to their meate do labour to get one by ſtrong exerciſe of the body, and diuerſe poynant and ſharpe ſawces: ſo hee that meditates muſt labour, by reading godly bookes, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent examination of his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or ſome holy act whereby to mortifie his affections, to ſtir vp in himſelfe a holy deuotion and zeale of meditating.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Eighth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the more to enflame him heereto, hee may thinke with himſelfe when hee comes to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate, that hee is making a iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to the moſt rich veine of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer and gold in the world, from whence hee may carry great and in-valuable Treaſures.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> Ninthly,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:14934:149"/>vpon the point of putting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to meditation, let him caſt himſelfe downe vpon his knees, or vſe ſuch humble and deuoute reuerence and geſture of body as is moſt agreeable, and with his heart and minde lift vp, let him conſider with himſelfe, on the one ſide, the greatneſſe of God and his preſence; on the other, his owne baſeneſſe and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of his ſinnes, and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that his ſo infinite Maieſty, that hee vouchſafeth vs free acceſſe and audience when wee come, ſaying with the bleſſed Patriarke; Shall <hi>I ſpeake vnto my Lord being but duſt and aſhes?</hi> Tenthly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> in concluſion let him commend himſelfe and his meditations to God, and pray him in Ieſus Chriſt to aſſiſt him in all his meditations, and not to depart from him, to take from him all matter and occaſion of diſtraction, and to giue him a comfortable and happy ſucceſſe in them. And let him vſe all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:14934:150"/>in the obſeruation of all theſe inſtructions, but yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſcruple or trouble of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, if at any time hee forget any of them: for it oft fals out, to ſuch as meditate much, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſo much preparation they are admitted to many heauenly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets: Onely our part is to vſe diligence, that wee omit not the things which are neceſſary.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2 Such things as accompany meditation are to be conſidered: and theſe are,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> firſt, Praeparatory prayer; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſecondly, préparatiues; thirdly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> colloquies with God. Firſt,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> I call this a preparatiue prayer, becauſe in the entrance of the meditation it is a ſhort re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt vnto God, that hee will direct all the powers and actions of our body and ſoule, to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, our owne ſaluation, and the good of others, praying him to giue vnto vs grace to meditate aright of heauenly things, and acknowledging that of our ſelues wee can doe nothing, but all our

Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, preparatiues, which are things going before meditation and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king way for it, that it may the more eaſily enter.

               <p>But if the matter of medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion bee ſpirituall, wee muſt then vſe another kinde of repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, namely, the ſoule to bee in the body as in a priſon, man to bee in this vale of teares, exiled amongſt bruite beaſts: or to thinke himſelfe intrenched with deuils or Angels; or to imagine a voyce diſcending from heauen, or Chriſt, or ſome of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, pronouncing the words which hee hath taken to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate on: That is the firſt prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue, and the ſecond is as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to begge of God to direct him to the right end of meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The third are Colloquies and ſpeeches with God,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:14934:151"/>are nothing elſe but pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers vnto God: and of neceſſity euery meditation and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation muſt haue ſome colloquy or ſpeech with God ioyned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, in which thankes are giuen vnto him, remiſſion of ſinnes, increaſe, or confirmation of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and other neceſſaries are to bee begged of God. Now in this buſineſſe we will open theſe three things; firſt,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> how theſe col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquies and prayers are to bee made; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ſecondly, how often,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when.

               <p>But yet in this moſt heauenly

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſecondly, the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of prayer, for by continuall vſe thereof, it is learned euen as all other Arts are. As cuſtome of riding maketh a man at length a good horſeman; ſo daily pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bringeth a man to great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in petitioning of GOD: thirdly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the paternes and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of holy men, deuoted to that heauenly exerciſe: For as one ſaith well: No Art is learned without a Maiſter.

Now, that we may proceede by a right line in handling this point, I will ſhew what Prayer is, what are the kindes of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; what is required, before, in, and after prayer.</p>
               <p n="1">1 That wee may know what Prayer is, it behoueth vs to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that there are diuerſe ſignifications thereof: of which the ſecond ſeemeth to make moſt for our purpoſe: for Prayer is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten taken for Petition; and ſo it is defined to bee a Petition of things fit to be asked of GOD:<note place="margin">Damaſc. lib. <hi>3.</hi> de fide. c. <hi>24.</hi>
                  </note> ſometimes it is taken for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the ſoule with GOD; whether asking anie thing of God, or giuing him thankes, or conferring with him about anie other thing, in which ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation it ſeemeth a Father tooke it,<note place="margin">Chryſ. Hom. <hi>10.</hi> in Gen.</note> when hee ſayd Prayer was a ſpeech or conference with God: But ſometimes it ſignifies gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally all the inward actes of the vnderſtanding, will, and other powers of the ſoule when they
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:14934:161"/>are lift vp vnto God and things aboue, in which ſenſe it ſeemes that the ſaid <hi>Damaſcen</hi> tooke it, when hee cals prayer the aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the minde vnto God.</p>
               <p>And if prayer be taken in this ſence, then meditation; contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, the praiſe of God, thankeſ-giuing, petition, obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, offring vp our ſelues, promiſe, proteſtation, accuſing of our ſelues, weeping for our ſinnes, examination of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, admiration and ſuch like actions, are all of them cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine kindes of prayer; and ſo to meditate, contemplate, giue thankes, examine the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and the reſt, are nothing elſe but to pray: yea to reade godly bookes to ſtirre vp our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotions, in this ſenſe is nothing elſe but to pray: For when to this end any doe reade godly bookes, then God ſpeakes to them, euen as man ſpeakes vnto God when hee prayes:<note place="margin">Bern. lib. de ſcala Clauſtr.</note> And this moued that deuoute Father to
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:14934:161"/>place the reading of godly bookes, amongſt the parts of prayer.</p>
               <p>That therefore in this ſenſe we may know what thoſe things are which ſeeme to bee all one with prayer: firſt, it muſt be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that to meditate is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but diligently and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiuely to weigh and ponder the thing propoſed, to the end to pray vnto God, or talke with him: And this I doe therefore adde, becauſe the diligent conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the Myſteries of faith and other things, as they are taught in the Church, or as any other end of them is propoſed, is not to bee named prayer: But this meditation, or conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is an act of the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, from which doth the act of the will immediately ariſe: For man plainely knowing what is good, and what is euill, is moſt eaſily moued to the loue of the one, and the deteſtation of the other: Hence the Kingly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:14934:162"/>ſaith, that in his <hi>meditation, the fire kindled:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 38.</note> And for this cauſe is prayer and meditation ſo cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled together that hardly can they bee handled aſunder.</p>
               <p>Secondly, contemplation is a certaine excellent and full me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of affections flowing out without any diſcourſe or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, whilſt the ſoule by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and perfect loue, is ioyned vnto God, and delighted in him: no otherwiſe then a man behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a moſt elegant image with fixed eyes, without turning his eyes this way or that, for the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular delight that hee takes therein.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the praiſe of God is to magnifie him for his excellent vertues and perfections inhaering in him.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Thankeſ-giuing is to approue himſelfe thankefull to him for his benefites receiued.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Petition is to aske ſomething of God, without any obſecration.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:14934:162"/>
Sixthly, Obſecration is to aske ſomething of God with ſome interpoſition of a ſacred thing moſt acceptable vnto him, by the power and ſight whereof hee may bee moued to giue what we demand; as when we aske him for the bloud and wounds of his moſt deerely beloued Sonne to grant our requeſts.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, Oblation is to offer vnto him our ſoules, bodies, all our actions, and whatſoeuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to vs, or is in vs.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, the examination of our conſciences is to remember our ſinnes before God, to aske pardon for them, and promiſe from the heart an amendment of them.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, Admiration is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent act of prayer, when the ſoule in contemplation doth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently admire and is aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed at the wiſedome, goodneſſe, power, and other workes of God, which for the moſt part is accompanied with inflamed affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:14934:163"/>and exclamations, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often with extaſies, and rauiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the ſoule. <hi>Luther</hi> was therefore wont to ſay, that prayer bringeth more profite then many labours of learning, and that therefore hee came to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of heauenly doctrine which hee had by theſe three in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, prayer, meditation and temptation: For prayer brings thoſe ſentences of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which in reading wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue into vſe.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2 But if you take prayer in the ſecond ſignification, then there are three ſorts or kindes of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, mentall, or of the minde, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, or of the tongue, and mixt, of both: and the reaſon heereof is, for that man doth negotiate and ſpeake with God, three man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of waies, namely, in heart, mouth, and in both together, and therefore there muſt needs bee three ſorts of prayer.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Eſay 29.</note> 
                     <hi>but their hearts are farre from mee: Ergo,</hi> this kinde of prayer is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:14934:164"/>called vocall becauſe onely vttered by the mouth, but that it might bee diſtinguiſhed from the mentall, which being onely made in the minde; the vocall alſo addes to the intention of the minde, words beſides.</item>
                  <item>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, the mixt kinde of prayer compoſed of both theſe kindes is, when hee that prayes doth partly with heart, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with his tongue pray vnto God: therefore it is not to bee called a mixt prayer, when any ſhall at one and the ſame time pray with the Spirit and wordes conceiued, reuoluing with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the things which hee ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, for that is vocall prayer: but that is a mixt prayer, when after the prayer conceiued, onely in ſpirit and minde hee that prayes doth ioyne vnto it a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call prayer of the mouth.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="3">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3 It followeth then that wee diſcourſe of the things required in prayer, that wee may pray aright: where, as we ſhall finde

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2 Now muſt wee come in a word to vocall prayer, this being either publicke or priuate, in both which is required due preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and attention, wee will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue theſe three things: Firſt,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that being about to pray, hee firſt enter into himſelfe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting himſelfe a little, and lifting vp his heart to God, hee direct the whole worke hee is about to the onely glory of God, begging of him aſſiſtance that he would eſtabliſh his minde in him alone: ſecondly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in the progreſſe of his prayer it is good, that firſt hee pronounce all the words di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly, without too much haſte: ſecondly, that by ſome paw ſings, as in the end of the Pſalmes, where wee ſay, <hi>Glory bee the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp;c.</hi> hee renew his attention, that if his minde bee diſtracted hee may gather it vp againe, and

               <p>There is another excellent way of vocall prayer, both eaſie and full of deuotion, and not ſubiect to diſtraction, which we may often vſe, but eſpecially in iourneying, and at ſuch times as wee cannot fitly haue opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to pray in another ſort: And that is to recite the Lords prayer, or any other which wee haue by heart, and that all by leaſure, inter-poſing ſo much time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt euery ſentence as that one may well pawſe and take breath, in which diſtance of time inward conſideration is to bee had:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> firſt, of the ſignification of the word: ſecondly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> or of the Maieſty of the perſon to whom wee ſpeake: or thirdly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of our owne vile and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable condition and eſtate.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3 The mixt kinde of prayer
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:14934:177"/>conſiſting both of mentall and vocall prayer, is more eaſie then that of the minde, and may bee vſed ſo often as a man ſhall finde himſelfe, in reſpect of ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition of body or mind, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for meditation.</p>
               <p>And this methode of praying may bee vſed, firſt,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> concerning the commandements of God: as for example, taking any precept of the Decalogue, or ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, and to ponder with himſelfe how ill hee hath obſerued that commandement vntill this houre, calling to minde the ſinnes hee hath committed againſt that commandement, and in minde begging pardon of them, and then concluding with the Lords prayer: ſecondly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſeuen capitall deadly ſinnes, <hi>ſeil.</hi> Pride, Auarice, Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Enuy, Gluttony, Anger and Slouth, hee may proceed in the ſame ſort, and beginning firſt with the ſinne of pride, hee may firſt obſerue and call to minde
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:14934:178"/>the ſinnes hee hath committed in that kinde; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſecondly, deſire par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for them; and thirdly, ſhut vp all with the Lords prayer vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally vttered.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the three faculties of the ſoule, Memory, Vnderſtanding and Willl, in which hee may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſame order of praying, mentally and vocally, as before, as for the point; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> firſt, why God gaue him a Memory; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſecondly, the ſinnes hee hath committed, not vſing the Memory to that end for which God gaue it him; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> thirdly, cloſing all with the Lords prayer. The ſame courſe to bee holden concerning the Will and Vnderſtanding:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, concerning the fiue ſenſes of the body, the Sight, Hearing, Taſting, Smelling and Touching: laſtly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> euery man may vſe the ſame forme of prayer in reſpect of the duties of his Calling, and that with much profite and faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; firſt,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> pondering why God hath placed him in that Calling
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:14934:178"/>and Degree: ſecondly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten hee hath ſinned againſt God, in neglecting and abuſing the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his Place &amp; Calling; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, concluding all with the Lords prayer from the heart and mouth, to ſtore him with fit graces for his Calling, and forgiue him the ſlips and errours committed in his Calling.</p>
               <p>Now before I put a period to this diſcourſe of prayer, it will not bee impertinent to ſtirre vp the heart of euery Chriſtian to the practiſe of this ſo neceſſary a duety: And the rather for that in this declining age of the world, moſt ſort of people are very remiſſe therein, for the moſt part making it a cuſtome rather then a duety of Religion.</p>
               <p>Religion, which indeed is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the worſhip of God, is of all morall vertues the moſt noble, producing many, both inward and outward moſt excellent actions: but of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward none ſo worthy as that of
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:14934:179"/>prayer and deuotion. This Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is a vertue reſting in the will of man, by which all due worſhip and reuerence is done vnto God, and prayer being the act of that vertue is the lifting vp of the minde vnto God; for the will moues the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to doe all due worſhip and ſeruice vnto God.</p>
               <p>But how great the dignity of prayer is, may not obſcurely bee deriued from Religion whoſe off-ſpring prayer is: for if Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion bee a vertue obtaining higheſt roome amongſt all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall vertues, then muſt prayer which is the act of Religion bee moſt excellent of all other actes of vertues: for albeit this bee no Theologicall act, yet more loftily then others, it reſpecteth and looketh at God as at the end and complement of all.</p>
               <p>Yea euen from the lifting vp of the minde, which by all the Saints of God is attributed vnto it, the worthineſſe of prayer
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:14934:179"/>ſhewes it ſelfe; as if the minde giuen to prayer ſcorned the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the creatures, lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp it ſelfe to the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Diuinity it ſelfe: And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the thing it ſelfe, if wee conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it according to the conditions of men, ſeemes to haue extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary worth in it: for if ſo great honour bee atchieued from the acquaintance and neereneſſe of Kings and Emperours, that men value it before riches, or any other thing beſides, as the often and much affected ambition of that honour doth teſtifie; what honour ſhall wee account that which the often conference and familiarity of God begets.</p>
               <p>Vpon this hinge doth hang the commendations of all the holy Fathers and Saints of God in all ages, all of them haue moſt greedily embraced this care; for this cauſe haue they hid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in Defarts and Dennes, for this alone forſooke all prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; this was the moſt fat
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:14934:180"/>paſture of great and worthy minds, and not onely thoſe whom Chriſt by his example taught, continuing all night in prayer, departing into the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart by the ſpace of forty daies, and for thirty yeares together without many words, attended his Fathers pleaſure; but euen thoſe fore-runners of his bleſſed comming did moſt religiouſly and duely in all ages reuerence this Diuine exerciſe of prayer; of which, what more vn-excepted witneſſes can bee, then <hi>Abraham</hi> walking the Deſarts, <hi>Moſes</hi> fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Sheepe, <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Eliſha</hi> inhabiting Mount <hi>Carmell?</hi> Who ſetting aſide all other reſpects, and taking vpon them the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the onely true God, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſo much to forget them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, that they ſeemed to carry mindes in the body voide of the body, as it were by prayer tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into God. With ſuch power is prayer endued, that the ſame thing which befell the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:14934:180"/>Maiſter of all Wiſedome, the Sonne of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whilſt hee prayed in Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> that his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance was changed, the ſame ſeemeth often to befall thoſe skilfull and zealous in prayer, that whilſt drawing the Diuine Beames from the ſociety of God, they ſhew ſome excellent thing to other men, as from a higher degree to be looked on, which may ſtrike reuerence into the beholders.</p>
               <p>Surely, it muſt needs bee mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of great ſublimity, which as ſoone as it gets place in mans heart, begets in it an immenſe hope of felicity: For ſeeing it is euident, that thoſe good things which make man happy can bee deriued from no other fountaine then from God, which though albeit the moſt bountifull God doe freely giue, yet will hee haue them demanded of him; it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe that hee who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues to himſelfe a firme purpoſe of this care and endeuour, hath
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:14934:181"/>already found out the right way of happineſſe, and hath happily entred into the ſame.</p>
               <p>Hence is it that our capitall enemy vſeth a thouſand machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, either to deterre vs from our enterpriſe, or to make vs go on with the leſſe animoſity and courage, for hee knowes, that ſuch as march on valiantly vnder this Enſigne, put all his Troupes to the ſword, themſelues being ſuch as illuſtrate many with the light of God, and ſtirre them vp to emulation: it cannot bee but ſuch as are deuoted to this moſt fruitfull exerciſe, muſt needs proſperouſly ſucceed.</p>
               <p>And not without cauſe, for there the mindes beſieged with all kind of euils, do gather new forces, and are made more puiſſant, both to tame the vnru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſſions, and alſo to acquire more vertues: For albeit they enter vn-armed, yet they go out armed and more valiant to fight; of which, that our Sauiours moſt
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:14934:181"/>couragious confronting of his aduerſaries after his prayer in the Garden, was a ſure argument: For Prayer eſtabliſheth the heart with magnanimity, it is concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued as if it were with the forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and ſtrength of God inſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into it: And what can ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the heart of man as the hand of the Creator ſtretched out to helpe? And how can hee want the Hand, that hath the Heart of his Creator? <hi>Where two or three are gathered together in my Name, there am I in the midst of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What ſhall I ſpeake of thoſe hidden comforts, the knowledge of God, the contempt of the world, the peace of conſcience, and many other true tokens of the ſonnes of God which are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in the mindes of ſuch as vſe this holy exerciſe? Beleeue it, whatſoeuer by the moſt wiſe and eloquent men and Orators of the world can in this kinde bee ſpoken, is leſſe,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:14934:182"/>then theſe Orators of God by thus exerciſing themſelues doe obtaine. What then ought wee to doe, ſeeing God requires this inceſſant duety of ours, but that ſo much of our ſhort time heere as may be taken from the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry employment about things of this preſent life, and our ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Callings, ſhould bee conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated vnto prayer? For this is, as it were, the very ſpirit of life, which lifteth vp man from the dregges of this world, into the fellowſhip and vnſpeakeble fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition of the moſt hidden things of God.</p>
               <p>There are but three ſorts of good things in this life, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with mans heart is rauiſhed, and all theſe are moſt richly attained vnto in this heauenly exerciſe.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> That which is profitable is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by by obtained, euen vnto a certaine kinde of immunity, from indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and need of the profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble good things: for it is plaine, that men addicted vnto prayer
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:14934:182"/>are leſſe vexed with hunger, thirſt, heate, cold, and ſuch like, and therefore they vſe both meate and cloathing moſt ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly.

               <p>That I may therefore giue a right farewell to this point; the drift of all men prayers is to bee ſo grounded on the vnmoueable rocke of faith, that there bee no haeſitation in him that prayes, but that hee aſſuredly truſts by Chriſt to obtaine the good things hee demands; which aſſurance muſt be deriued from theſe 3. rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which are ſo ſtrong againſt all the incurſions of ſins, paſſions and all temptations, and ſo able to affect the heart, as that they can moue euen the ſtones.</p>

Seeing therefore God hath made all his workes to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt his goodneſſe, and nothing makes ſo much to the end of his glory and manifeſtation, as to haue mercy on men moſt miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſinners, certaine hope may be conceiued that hee will grant pardon to them that faithfully aske it, and giue them both grace and glory.</p>
               <p>God is more propenſe to doe good, then the fire is to burne, if therefore the fire, as often as
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:14934:183"/>nothing hinders it, burnes and conſumes all that is put vpon it: Surely, nor will God ſo long as nothing with-ſtands him, but haue mercy; but nothing hinders God, nor can, as long as man doth ſeriouſly will and deſire God to haue mercy on him: therefore euen the moſt wicked may hope, if they ſeriouſly deſire it, that God will forgiue their ſinnes, and giue them all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries.</p>

               <p>Seeing then that God, when hee ſheweth mercy, doth a thing to himſelfe honourable, firſt, to the glory of his great Name, agreeable to his Palate and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and therefore pleaſant to him: yea, let mee ſay alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable; for ſo many ſeruants hee gaines, as there be men on whom hee ſhewes mercy.

               <p>For it is a doctrine cleere by the ſacred Scriptures, and holy Fathers, that wee were all brought forth into this world, not to reſt and ſettle vpon the brittle good things of this life, and in them to ſolace our ſelues, ſeeing they are the leaſt, loweſt and vileſt of the good things of God; but that vſing them ſo farre forth as they ſerue for our neceſſity, according to Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, wee ſpend our whole liues in the ſublime and high workes of our great God; who to this end created vs, that hee might make vs bleſſed, and the enioyers of his owne ſelfe, who

               <p>Againe, wee may obſerue, that albeit God haue not tyed vs vnder the commination of eternall death, that wee ſhould perpetually intend nothing elſe but his obſeruance, but onely then, when any of his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements are to bee obſerued: yet by the law of equity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wee ought to obſerue our ſelues, as the ſonnes of ſo great a Father; not onely men of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Profeſſion, but euen all Chriſtians, are bound to procure vnto themſelues a more ſublime, and heauenly degree of ſanctity, and euermore to ſerue that ſo mighty a Lord and Father.

               <p>Seeing then God is an infinite Good, that muſt needs bee the greater good worke which is more purely performed in his ſight: For declaration whereof it is to bee noted, that it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:14934:201"/>the ſeruant of God, who would pleaſe his Lord, to plant in his ſoule a very puiſſant will or habite of willing ingendred of ſtrong and frequent actes of willing it: which will or habite, ſo ingraffed in him may moue him and make him thinke, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer hee doth in body or ſoule, whatſoeuer hee ſhall thinke or ſpeake, nay, all the vertues hee ſhall acquire, together with this ſame remedy of his ſoule, and all his deuotion; I ſay, that all theſe things are done, becauſe God would haue it ſo, doth euer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire them of vs, and is for his infinite goodneſſe moſt worthy of them; or elſe becauſe, that by theſe duties hee ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme ſomething acceptable vnto him.</p>
               <p>Once the Diuine Maieſty ſaid to his Diſciples,<note place="margin">Ioh. 15.</note> That <hi>for this cauſe hee ſpake vnto them, that his ioy might bee in them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> But this is the ioy of God which is in vs, as one ſaith, whereby hee vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafeth
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:14934:201"/>to reioyce concerning vs,<note place="margin">Aug.</note> namely, when wee are obedient to his will. But no manner of ſeruice is ſo acceptable to him, as that the ſeruant of God ſhould ſo will that which hee willeth, ſo deſire what hee deſireth, that whatſoeuer himſelfe is or can be, may with all his force bee pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out to the obedience of God, as hee that in euery worke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued no other end which might moue him to worke, then to bee willing to pleaſe God, and to do a worke acceptable to him. This I ſay is the thing I meane, that he ſhould in ſome ſort forger the good and glory which may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall himſelfe from the practiſe of vertue, being onely mindefull of God which requires it; and for this cauſe onely would doe it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God willeth it, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth it, and not without great cauſe, of his goodneſſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it. To make this plaine by example; Conceiue a ſicke man who for the recouery of his
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:14934:202"/>health deſires ſome meate, or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, and not onely deſires it, but procures it; in the meane time it fals out, that ſome deere friend of his fals ſicke of a more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous diſeaſe, and ſtands much more need of that meate or Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke: heere hee that was firſt ſicke being vnmindfull of his ſickeneſſe how great ſoeuer, and of that deſire hee had to it for his owne ſake, beginnes now to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the ſame, and to procure it, not to himſelfe, but to his friend; ſo that the loue to his friend makes him deſire and procure that which is needfull for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, not to ſatiſfie his owne ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, but the neceſſity of his friend: ſo that after hee hath by ſundry wayes buſying himſelfe found it, hee perceiues in his minde a certaine boyling deſire to get it for his friend, as forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that hee needs it himſelfe, and hauing gotten it, reioyceth greatly that the will and neceſſity of his friend is ſatiſfyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="325" facs="tcp:14934:202"/>
The like ought it to be to him that ſhould moue the ſeruant of God to euery deſire and worke, euen the like by all meanes: namely, that in his ſoule hee feele an inſtinct whereby to deſire and do that is good: but that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire muſt be becauſe God willeth that the thing bee done, and by that leades a man to performe obedience to him, as if it were very neceſſary to him; and euer forgetting that by theſe vertues which hee ſought, deſired, or wrought, hee ſhould attaine glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and ſaluation. For it is a farre more neceſſary end, that wee therefore worke becauſe God would haue vs to doe it, and for his goodneſſe which moues vs to loue and ſerue him; then that wee our ſelues ſhould poſſeſſe glory: For wee ought to deſire that wee may enioy glory and good things chiefly for that cauſe becauſe God would haue vs to deſire and haue them, and that in hauing them wee might
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:14934:203"/>loue him, and after an excellent manner ſerue him, and not for our owne profite, ioy, or glory.</p>
               <p>And ſo great is the magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and goodneſſe of GOD, that by how much as wee doe in this manner the more deſire or do any good thing, ſo much more ſhall be our glory in heauen. This inſtruction, I confeſſe, may ſeeme vnto many, to be full of difficulty; but ſurely, the beginnings of all things doe appeare to be ſuch to all beginners: for they iudge they ſhall neuer attaine to that they haue begunne: but yet ſo long doe they exerciſe themſelues in thoſe things, that by continuall exerciſe, they become Maiſters, where at firſt they durſt not call themſelues Schollers.</p>
               <p>And obſerue it for trueth, that if any man haue a will inflamed with deuotion, hee ſhall doe all theſe things with ſuch facilitie, that in a ſinall ſpace of time hee may ſeeme to haue done wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full things. But vnto him, who
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:14934:203"/>is not enkindled with ſo great a flame of deuotion, this muſt be a rule which wee now lay downe, wherein ſhall diſtinctly bee tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the manner and reaſon which hee muſt obſerue in attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vnto it. Let a man on the one ſide propoſe God as his chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt friend, and himſelfe on the other ſide: when the will is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to deſire any vertue, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable thing, let a man conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with what end hee it mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and hee ſhall perceiue for the moſt part, that hee is moued either with feare of puniſhment, or loue of glory and vertue: Now this motiue ought not to ſatiſfie vs, although it bee not euill, but ſeeing mans will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented and aſſiſted by the grace of God, hath ſo much freedome and power, in ſome meaſure, as to forſake the one, and chuſe the other; and ſeeing we know the will of God to be much more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, and more woorthie to moue vs, then our owne will,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:14934:204"/>wee muſt now forbeare to bee moued after that manner as wee haue beene, and turne all our will to deſire the ſame thing after the beſt manner, namely, becauſe he would haue it ſo, who is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of all obedience.</p>
               <p>Surely, he ſhould of right ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count himſelfe vile and wretched who deſires or doth any thing, moued thereunto with a naturall deſire, albeit the thing be good and holy, ſeeing hee hath euer the will of GOD preſent before him which ſhould mooue him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to will and deſire; but chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly, ſeeing GOD giues euer ſuch ſtrength as that one may forſake his owne will, as it is ſtirred vp with a naturall deſire, albeit a good deſire, and be moued with a heauenly deſire.</p>
               <p>And ſo much difference there is betwixt theſe two ſcopes and motiues, that nothing in this world differs more from another, then theſe two doe the one from the other; ſo that the one of theſe
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:14934:204"/>is incomparably more excellent then another: as the Sunne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the brightneſſe of a candle; the Sea, a drop of water; infinite talents of Gold, a peece of Lead. Therefore let vs euer endeuour to deſire, and worke, being moued with ſo happy an end and motiue, ſeeing the Diuine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe moſt deſirous of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement and glory doth binde vn to do all our workes, corporall and ſpirituall, great and ſmall, proceeding from the body or the ſoule, euen ſuch as are done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our naturall diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to do them, I ſay, onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the will of God wee ſhould doe them. For all our actions from the leaſt to the greateſt, ſerue for the conſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this naturall life; and as wee cannot forſake them, ſo in vſing them for the loue of God they much further to the increaſe of a holy and happy life: and ſo the leaſt and meaneſt worke wee doe is, in the ſight of God, of
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:14934:205"/>more worth then the beſt and higheſt action performed of him that hath not the ſame ſcope. And indeed it is a thing wonderfull and worthy of memory, that in the ſight of God it ſhould bee a thing of more dignity to eate meate with this ſcope and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, then with any other motiue, as namely, that wee enioy the glory of heauen, to faſt, or powre out our bloud for the truth.</p>
               <p>Not that it is not an excellent thing to deſire the poſſeſſion of heauens glory, but for that this motiue is ſo much more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent then the other, as the whole world ouer-values a nut ſhell. That therefore wee may bee induced, through this happy motiue, to doe all that wee doe, all the motions of body and ſoule bending vnto this end, wee muſt bee very intent that wee neuer paſſe from one worke to another, nor neuer beginne any worke vntill wee feele our
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:14934:205"/>ſelues to bee moued vnto it for this, that wee thinke, or know, that God would haue vs to doe it: For which purpoſe wee muſt know, that God with an infinite iubile and deſire, wiſheth to bee beloued or poſſeſſed of all men, and with the ſame will, wiſheth that with euery motion of loue, which in euery moment of our liues we work, we ſhold loue him: and how often ſoeuer we ſhall loue, or do any other thing, wee ſhould doe it, being attracted thereunto with this his infinite will: ſo that this is the rule wee muſt follow in all things, that whenſoeuer wee will doe any thing, wee muſt neuer beginne it, vntill hauing firſt caſt our eyes vpon God, wee ſhall perceiue that wee deſire this for the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite ioy which hee hath of this our good worke. Which being ſenſibly knowne, that God is moſt worthy to bee obeyed and ſerued in this ſo ſublime a nature, then obeying this will, we bring
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:14934:206"/>into execution whatſoeucr wee determined, as altogether forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of our owne good. For iuſt it is, that his bleſſed Will who created all wils, ſhould haue that preheminence and dominion ouer all wils, that not onely they ſhould obey him in all hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, but alſo that whatſoeuer wee doe, wee ſhould doe it, as forgetting to performe our owne proper wils, and obtaine our owne glory, but that both in the one and the other Gods holy will may be fulfilled, without any other reſpect.</p>
               <p>But becauſe as many men think themſelues rich, when indeede they are but poore, reckoning their chickens in the ſhell; ſo many thinking they feele the ſaid motiue and eſteeming themſelues to haue done great things, doe at length finde they are but ſmall: for it eaſily falleth out, that one conſidering the ſublimitie that conſiſts in louing of GOD, and deſirous of thoſe excellent and
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:14934:206"/>true good things, and alſo being in the fauour of God and ſtate of ſaluation, hath an enkindled de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to enioy that loue, and yet that deſire is no perfect worke.</p>
               <p>For albeit that deſire be of a thing that is perfect, yet is that deſire no perfect worke, if the perfect motiue of the minde bee wanting, namely, that ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire proceed from a ſtrong wil we haue, to deſire ſuch loue, becauſe God would haue vs to enioy it to our aduauncement, which hee greatly deſires. The ſame that wee ſay of this deſire, may alſo be ſpoken of many, who are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with a great zeale of ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Soules, or good of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publike; and ſuch as are hungry and thirſtie for Righteouſneſſe, and weepe for the euilles which they ſee and know to bee in the world: all which things are good, but yet may bee moſt abiect and defectiue, if they want the ſaid true motiue and ſcope: therefore wee muſt be very regardfull, that
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:14934:207"/>whatſoeuer wee doe, we be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vnto it with this motiue.</p>
               <p>And that wee haue ſpoken of theſe words, ought to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode and practiſed in all thoſe infinite motions which doe offer themſelues to the Soule of what kinde ſoeuer, yea in the reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of euery temptation: for we muſt ſo labour, that Gods will may reigne in ours; as that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing muſt ariſe from our will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</p>
               <p>It is true, that ſuch as enter into this courſe, ſhall find much difficulty, and ſpend much time in acquiring this excellent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue: but let none be diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, for doe not many worldly men labour all their liues for vile things of no worth, &amp; yet do not obtaine them? But we ſhall ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obtaine this gift, if with inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous humility wee labour for it with perſeuerance: but he ought greatly to reproue himſelfe: who ſhall thinke it is of any eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, dignity, or price, to obſerue
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:14934:207"/>theſe things, and yet ſhall not for the greatneſſe of the rewarde promiſed, which is to obtayne the ſaid motiue, be ſtirred vp to ſeeke it.</p>
               <p>And ſurely, it is not amiſſe to prae-admoniſh all men, that at the beginning, great coldneſſe wil happen vnto him that directs his workes after ſo high a pitch, doing all things to God alone: and hee may wonder, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing taken the more ſublime way, yet hee ſhould finde leſſe deuotion, as hee may wonder, that approaching to the fire, yet feeles it growe more colde: but we muſt know, that whoſo doth well conſider the cauſe heereof, ſhall finde, that of neceſſitie ſuch coldeneſſe will ſeize vpon him, and yet his worke is of no leſſe worth: for the cauſe heereof is, for that we neyther doe nor loue any thing more for our owne proper good, as we were wont, and is naturall vnto vs: but for the onely loue of God: wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:14934:208"/>from vs the roote, from whence commonly and naturally all ioy and pleaſure was wont to ſpring, that is, our owne good and quiet; and wee aſſume an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others good, namely, the glorie of God, for the reſt and end of our labours: which being a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall thing, and vnaccuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to vs, no wonder if it bring much paine to make ſuch a change. From this ariſeth that luke-warmeneſſe; vntill wee be accuſtomed to feele, eſteeme, price, loue, and much more to valew GODS glorie then our owne, as the thing which wee loue much more. And hauing gotten this, then wee ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the fire that will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any cold fit to tarry on vs.</p>
               <p>Now the end being knowne, for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which we muſt doe all things, ſome may admire, that ſeeing the ſacred Scripture, chiefly the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel being ſo perfect, and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſuch exact obedience: yet it ſeemes not euer to propoſe this
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:14934:208"/>end and motiue, when it admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth, commendeth &amp; prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, but for the moſt part either threatens puniſhments or inuites by promiſing glory.</p>
               <p>To this I ſay, that our bleſſed redeemer the Sonne of God, the author of all Euangelicall doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine being in himſelfe moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, did often in his owne perſon take vpon him the things which belonged to our frailty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, that hee might deſcend to our frailty, as fleeing, hiding himſelfe, ſeruing death, &amp;c. ſo his pleaſure was to write his doctrine in ſuch words as our fraile and miſerable conditions required, who for the moſt part are moued to do all things either for hope of glory, or feare of puniſhments.</p>
               <p>But yet obſerue withall that as our Sauiour took vpon him theſe our infirmities with great perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and loue, ſo the Saints of God doe heare the Goſpell and accordingly doe liue, mooued with threatnings and promiſes
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:14934:209"/>therein contained, yet without the loſſe of the excellent motiue of which we haue ſpoken. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of if any man doubt, and thinke theſe not to be compatible or can ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d together, namely the threats of hell and glory of heauen, with the motiue of Gods will: let him conſider, that when our Sauiour ſaith, <hi>except ye alſo repent ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh;</hi> in this threatning are two things to be noted. Firſt the puniſhment threatned. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the will of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God threatens: and this is his will, that we ſhould ſerue him arid not periſh. The true ſeruant of God, ought to obey this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, not that he may auoide the puniſhment, but becauſe God who threatens would haue vs to repent, and not to fall into that puniſhment. So being mindfull that Gods deſire is wee ſhould ſerue him, and not fal into ſo great an euill, as once forgetting the puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, we repent &amp; turne to God. With this perfection there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:14934:209"/>do we work, yet mooued by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>minations of the Scripture. And ſo the Scripture conteining that moſt high and perfect ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of God, albeit withall, it hath that which ſeemes to be of frailty and infirmity, whereby to ſtoope to our frailty, and to moue vs to doe as our frailty requires.</p>
               <p>And that promiſes and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings in Scripture are thus to be vnderſtood, may appeare by that firſt and great couenant of ſeruing God with all the heart, &amp;c. which he doth not ſufficiently perform,<note place="margin">Mat. 21.</note> who towards God doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow all his powers to ſerue him, and both to deſire celeſtiall glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and abhorre the paines of hell, as well deſiring that, as deteſting this in the ſame manner as we haue ſpoken: namely that the laſt and chiefe end of both be, the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of Gods will and his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and glory.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>Inſtruction.</hi> That it be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth all men, but chiefly thoſe who are ſacred perſons, to ſerue
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:14934:210"/>God according to this more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime and heauenly manner.</p>
               <p>There is no doubt, but that God being in the higheſt heauens is alſo iuſtly eſteemed for the moſt high God; but the ſeruice and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience due vnto him, muſt be performed in a moſt ſublime and exact manner. That which our Sauiour ſaid to one hee meant of al,<note place="margin">Math. 19.</note> if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandements: it was not the young mans raske alone, if thou wilt be perfect, ſell all thou haſt and giue vnto the poore; but euery mans part is in that ſeruice.</p>
               <p>This was well patternd out vnto vs by the ſonne of Maieſty it ſelfe, the Sonne of God, who forſook all things on earth, whoſe ſacred life was exerciſed with many grieuous labours, not that that moſt holy and princely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſtood need of them, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it much concerned vs to imitate thoſe ſacred ſteps; he wold become a ſeruant that he might teach vs to ſerue. In all things he
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:14934:210"/>ſerued, that we might vnderſtand what a labourſome and exact ſoule in all vertue that muſt be, that rightly deſires to ſerue and loue him: No man is exempt from that great commandement of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God with all the heart, with all the ſoule, with all the minde, with all the ſtrength, with all the heart, with all the affections, all the ſoule, with all the life, all the minde, with all the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: all the ſtrength, with all the externall things of the body. It is the part of the heart to know, of the ſoule to will, of the minde to be able: of the ſtrength, from the heart, ſoule and will, to know will and be able; nor only with the good health of the body, with ſtrength, beauty, agility, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gifts, but alſo with our ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, dignity, and authority, to glorifie God, and do him due and meet obedience.</p>
               <p>So that whatſoeuer good thing we can doe in heart, ſoule, minde, and ſtrength, God requires
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:14934:211"/>of euery one vnder the neceſſity of a commandement. Yea when all is done that was commanded vs, we may ſay we are vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſeruants.</p>
               <p>If he bee worthy of reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, who going about to doe ſome neceſſary and profitable thing, ſhall ſlightly caſt it off, and put himſelfe into ſome baſe and abiect buſineſſe; How much more is he to bee blamed, who being borne to this end, that with all his heart, ſoule, minde, &amp; ſtrength he ſhould ſerue the Lord, who is moſt worthy thereof, and from whom there is moſt benefit to be expected: yet omits this and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes himſelfe to the ſeruice of the creatures &amp; vanities of the world, which doe ſuddenly vaniſh and bring much harme with them?</p>
               <p>As if all be to be blamed who ſerue not God in this exact man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, how much more are they ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to a ſeuere penalty, who haue dedicated themſelues by a ſpeciall function to his ſeruice, as
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:14934:211"/>are in ſome ſort his familiars in houſe and table. How exactly ought they to follow the ſteps of him that hath called them,<note place="margin">Math. 19.</note> ſaying follow me?</p>
               <p>Which being ſpoken to all ſorts of men, we cannot but ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thus much of euery mans du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty out of it, that it is not enough, that we doe the thing we do with loue, but of loue and for loue. For theſe are the footſteps which he commandeth vs to follow. So wee muſt not fulfill ſomething of that is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but the whole. Nor is it ſufficient in his ſeruice that we do our duty with loue, or loue accompanying it; but it behoueth vs to doe it of loue and for loue. We ſee the ſeruant ſerues his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter with loue, who loues his Lord and Maſter, but yet doth it not for loue, ſeeing hee would not ſerue him except he expected a reward from him. But he ſhould indeed ſerue him with loue and for loue, if he ſerued him only for this, that his Lord deſired it, and
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:14934:212"/>held his ſeruice gratefull: and becauſe he loues the goodneſſe and ſociety of his Lord, without any other reſpect. And ſuch obedience it is that wee learne of our maſter Chriſt; ſaying, <hi>follow mee.</hi> Which ſignifies that wee muſt do whatſoeuer we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to doe with loue and for loue.</p>
               <p>For to follow Chriſt, is to do that which he did for our inſtruction, and in the ſame manner that hee did it. But vndoubtedly he did all things with loue, and for loue, ſeeing that is the moſt ſublime manner of working, therefore ſo muſt we do, albeit we cannot do it with ſuch perfection as he did, therefore wee muſt not thinke that God commands vs to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him in doing onely, and not in the manner of doing too: ſeeing it is to no purpoſe to doe, if the manner of doing aright be abſent; namely to do with loue, and for loue. For wee cannot ſuſpect that ſo excellent, magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:14934:212"/>and liberall a Lord as this, would teach vs a doctrine of ſmal vſe and profit; but of ſinguler moment, ſo that we obſerue ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as well the manner as matter.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4 <hi>Inſtruction,</hi> That the cruell ſlaughter which ſin hath made in mans ſoule, is the cauſe of ſuch great difficulty in ſeruing God after this ſublime and heauenly manner. For this purpoſe, thoſe that will ſerue God aright, muſt conſider their owne diſpoſitions that they may be able aright to meete with their owne defects, therefore they muſt know that the euill wherby they are drawen from ſeruing God after this moſt diuine manner, proceeds from ſin, which hath weakened the ſoule, and ſubdued it to it ſelfe. For if ſinne had not interpoſed it ſelfe, we ſhould haue done eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good thing with much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility; but ſinne once arryuing in the Soule, all our deſires, wills and appetites are become ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, diſordered and rebellious,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:14934:213"/>by that grieuous ſpeciall diſeaſe ariſing from ſinne, that now loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that which is good, wee ſcarce loue, affect, or deſire any thing, ſaue the moſt abiect, worth leſſe and vitious things, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that infinit good vnto which wee were created, as the thing wherein we haue neither relliſh nor ſauour.</p>
               <p>And hence proceeds the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and perturbation of the ſoule which we feele in our ſelues ſo much diſtracted from the true God, whereunto we were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the thing which is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and onely good being caſt off, we incline euer, and greedily follow that which is euill. Yet muſt we know, that howſoeuer this ſin hath made ſuch a ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of graces in the ſoule, that there is not one friend left to take armes againſt it; yet doth not our obligation ceaſe from binding vs to doe what is our duty, and for which we came into this world. For albeit this great infirmity
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:14934:213"/>doth ſo infeeble vs that we doe all good things with great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; yet doth it not make vs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſo impotent, but that we are capable of grace and diuine fauour, whereby to repaire this our former ouerthrow and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
               <p>Beſides we muſt obſerue, that by ſo much more doe we grow to an admirable diſpoſition of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God aright, which diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had euer remained in the ſoule vnto all good things, if ſinne had not diſeaſed it, by how much more we ſhall haue our appetites and deſires repaired and diſpoſed, which by ſinne were formerly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed. And he ſhall haue them repaired, who with an attentiue care and profound conſideration of the things we ſpeake of, ſhall direct them all to the Lord, with a repugnancy to all things that are without the will of this Lord: and a following of all ſuch reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies as are here deſcribed. And in that degree wherein any ſhall
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:14934:214"/>obtaine this, in the ſame ſhall hee be aduanced here in ſanctity, and afterwards in glory. And there is no doubt, but herein one may ſo profit by aſſiduity and diligence as that he may doe all things with great faclity and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light: to which hee ſhall be the more eaſily aduanced, if he often and attentiuely read theſe inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
               <p n="5">5 <hi>Inſtruction.</hi> That wee haue in our bodies and ſoules ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient meanes for the reparation of this decay and ruine, if they be ſtirred vp by the grace of Gods ſpirit. As we haue both body and ſoule, ſo wee haue in both of them inſtrumentes wherewith to worke. For as the body hath feete to walke, hands to worke, mouth to ſpeake, and the like, ſo the ſoule hath the vnderſtanding where-with to know, the will wherewith to deſire, and diuerſe other faculties of the appetite. But it muſt bee obſerued, that the more excellent the worker
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:14934:214"/>is together with the inſtrument, ſo much more worthy is the worke, ſo that all things concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the acte bee ſuteable. Corporall actions haue ſo much more excellency in them, by how much the inſtrument of the ſoule concurring to the act is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent.</p>
               <p>Now that is called a ſingular inſtrument, which to the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the act is mooued by a good end: Therefore the moſt excellent inſtruments are the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and the will, which can bee mooued of God alone: as wee haue ſaid in the ſecond inſtruction. Therefore of ſmall worth are corporall things which doe not ſo proceede. And this is it that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4.</note> bodily labour profiteth little. But the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the ſoule are of another kinde: namely, becauſe of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues they may bee of great profit.</p>
               <p>As if one exerciſing his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding ſhoulde conſider,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:14934:215"/>how baſe and abiect the honors of this world were, and of what value thoſe things which God commands are; and how vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable that glory is to which we aſpire; alſo to know how one may moderate his paſſions and the like. Againe, if one exerciſe himſelfe in his will, louing that which he knowes is good, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing that is euill. Such refuſals of the ſoule ſhould be very profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, albeit the body were very idle; for by ſuch exerciſes would be produced excellent habits, and the euill habits deſtroied; which thing of it ſelfe is very lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, albeit done for the only loue of vertue as Philoſophers did: yet much more being in a Chriſtian who hath faith, but moſt of all, if in euery worke wee ioyne faith with our intention actually di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected vnto God.</p>
               <p>Hence may it be obſerued, how much euery one ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in the actions of the ſoule; which thing he may doe, whether
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:14934:215"/>he bee imployed in body or no in euery time and place, ſo that ſpeaking with another in any temporall affaire, yet may he in ſoule worke, by louing God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caling to mind ſome of his works.</p>
               <p>This may ſeeme difficult to him that hath not attained the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit thereof, yet cuſtome wil make it eaſie, as we muſt remember that vertue is practiſed about difficult things. Therefore violence is to be vſed to the wil, that thou maiſt become an induſtrious workman, to doe ſingular things with faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Which if thou doeſt not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, no maruaile is it, that thou canſt not be more deuout towards God, ſeeing hee is euer ready to aſſiſt thy deſires vnto that which is good, and to withſtand thy proneneſſe to euill, ſo that thou doe rightly vſe the meanes.</p>
               <p>And be ſure that if thou deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt on earth to be a great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent friend and ſeruant of God thou ſhalt the ſooner attaine vnto it, by how much thou doſt daily
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:14934:216"/>more and more vſe theſe inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente of the ſoule, thy vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and will, at all times and places.</p>
               <p>And this is it which aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the Saints of GOD to ſo much glory in heauen, the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect whereof is ſo blameable on earth. Seeing then our higheſt glory conſiſts herein for the moſt part, that wee worke by theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of the ſoule, and our ruine in the neglect of this exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe. Let vs ſee what courſe wee muſt take who haue as yet beene euen liueleſſe, to vſe theſe inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the foule. And that wee may begin with the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, leauing the will to the next inſtruction, we will premiſe this theologicall and Philoſophicall fundamentall rule: that our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall appetite doth naturally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that to which it is inclined, &amp; ſeemes pleaſant to it, not ſtanding need of any thing to helpe or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uite vnto it, but rather neceſſarily &amp; as it were coactedly deſiring it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="353" facs="tcp:14934:216"/>
But ſo doth not the will work, bur firſt conſults with reaſon, and finding that the thing is conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for it, it is then freely mooued to will and deſire it. Therefore the Philoſopher ſaid, that nothing was deſired that was not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne. Whence we collect that the knowledge of the ſoule which wee haue in our vnderſtanding, is like a light whereby the will may ſee what it ought to deſire. This therefore being preſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, we muſt chiefely regard, that to doe well and perfectly, the vnderſtanding doe not erre in knowledge, which bceing had, preſently the will is mooued to deſire that which is ſo knowne; but if the vnderſtanding doe erre, which often comes to paſſe by the malice which blindeth vs, or happily it erreth not, but the will through the liberty it hath to euill, will not follow that it knowes to be good; then man falls into all kind of miſchiefe; therefore omitting many things
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:14934:217"/>which may ſerue for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; this is chiefely to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that we be moſt attentiue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer when we will vſe the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that when we would deſire to do any good worke, or to get a diſpoſition thereunto, namely, to be deſpiſed of men, to flee all delights of the world, which godly men euer abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, in theſe and the like which ſeeme to be grieuous vnto vs to doe, or deſire, by and by wee muſt vſe the helpe of the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, whereby wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider and apprehend theſe things as moſt pretious and acceptable to God, and ſuch as doe accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the godly men to heauen, without which he is euer out of his way to that happineſſe.</p>
               <p>Which aſſoone as it knoweth to be ſuch, then the will takes courage to will and imbrace that thing and alſo to practiſe it. For albeit the will, as it is aſſiſted by Gods Spirt, worketh ſweetly, yet often the difficulty and ſharpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:14934:217"/>of the thing, ſo deters it, that it fayleth to worke, omitting the duty it is bound vnto; but as we indeuour to make way vnto it by the vnderſtanding as I haue ſaid, it will aſſume ſuch courage and ſtrength, that (the excellency of the worke being knowne, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit moſt painfull) it will deſire to do it, and almoſt with as great facility will doe it, as that thing which it naturally deſireth. Hee that workes after this manner, ſhall eaſily become a man of ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uler vertue, and ſhall make a wonderfull repaire in his ſoule of the ſlaughter and ruine which ſinne hath there made, and ſhall alſo with great facility doe that which maketh men happy, both in earth and heauen, namely know in a great meaſure the wonderfull things of God and knowing to loue them, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to reioyce in them, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all earthly ioyes and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures for them.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> 6 <hi>Inſtruction,</hi> That God is
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:14934:218"/>pleaſed to giue to all his Saints and ſuch as from the heart ſeeke to ſerue him, ſuch a ſtrength of will, whereby they may both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire &amp; loue, refuſe &amp; deteſt euery thing (in a great meaſure) which either helps forwards or hinders their ſaluation. This is ſurely to be knowen of all, as the chiefe foundation of all this diſcourſe, and of all holineſſe of life: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyning a memorable Cannon of the freedome &amp; ſtrength of will, which God by his Holy Spirit hath renewed and repayred in the ſoules of his faithful ſeruants, and ſo rowſing vp the ſoule from a dead ſleepe and ſpiritual lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, and benummedneſſe.</p>
               <p>But here let no man deceiue himſelfe, as though this freedome of will were naturall and in his owne power; for without the goodneſſe of God,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 3.</note> wee cannot thinke a good thought as of our ſelues; How much leſſe can wee will or worke it? But preſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this, wee ſay it is in mans
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:14934:218"/>power to deſire, or not to deſire any thing which hee iudgeth to be deſired or refuſed, and that, to this or that end as often as hee liſteth: as for the purpoſe. There is no man but he may deſire to be diſ-reputed and diſ-eſteemeſt of men: albeit thing to ſome men be difficult to incline vnto: he may alſo to diuerſe ends de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it, and make choice of theſe ends as he liſteth. For a man may deſire it, thereby to obtaine the modeſty of the minde which is a good end: he may alſo affect it, to the end that in ſomething he may be like the Sonne of God, which is yet a better end: and he may wiſh it, that by abiection &amp; contept, he may be ſo diſpoſed to God-wards, that God may find in him an acceptable obedience, by perfect loue &amp; charity, &amp; this is the beſt end of all the reſt.</p>
               <p>Now to giue an example of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to will and deſire a thing: a man may omit and refuſe, and not deſire to be eſteemed, or to
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:14934:219"/>be he loued before other men, and that to the ſame ends which wee haue ſpoken; albeit by corruption of nature he be inclined hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, greatly to deſire to be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and reputed in like manner, as it is in euery mans power (in ſome degree) whom Gods ſpirit hath ſanctified, to deſire or not to deſire any thing, ſo is it to doe the ſame as often as he will bend his will and vſe the holy meanes thereunto. Yea euery houre as by how much oftner hee inclines and inforces his will to deſire or not to deſire, ſo much ſooner ſhall he extinguiſh in the ſoule all viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous habits, and ingender thoſe vertuous.</p>
               <p>For better declaration where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, let it be remarkeable that to produce the act of willing the thing which we abhor, we muſt conſider that God is hereby ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, in that we doe deſire this thing, and incline ourwils vnto it, and as it were vſe violence to the will to effect it: euen as the ſicke
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:14934:219"/>deſires the bitter potion, becauſe it brings health with it, which yet he naturally hateth becauſe it is bitter.</p>
               <p>But the act of not deſiring, that which naturally wee wiſh and effect, is, whilſt conſidering that the thing is not acceptable<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to God nor profitable for vs, we incline and in ſome ſort inforce the will, that it ſhould not effect and deſire it. And this ſhall be truly not to deſire, when wee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the will, albeit there remain a certaine repugnancy of ſenſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, as we ſee it fall out in the ſick man, who will not eat the meat, albeit hee haue an appetite to it, becauſe it is hurtfull to him; and it is ſomething profitable for him, to be vnwilling to eat it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the inordinate appetite hee hath to that meat be not taken away.</p>
               <p>So we ſee that we may produce the acts of vertue as often as wee will, being aſſiſted by the mighty working of Gods holy ſpirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="360" facs="tcp:14934:220"/>
But we muſt conſider, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the continuall care we ought to haue of exerciſing the will to deſire the good things that are to be deſired and to omit and refuſe the euill, whereby the euill ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits being rooted vp, we may plant thoſe that are good: it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes vs much, moſt often to vſe this preſent inſtruction, whereby to reſtraine thoſe firſt motions, which do much confront and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne euen men much giuen to vertue: or thoſe motions in which we are longer captiued, to which we do ſometimes conſent, though in ſmaller ſinnes; as to be delighted that our words or actions ſhould be had in ſome eſtimation, or other mens to whom in ſome carnal and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſpect we ſtood affected: or to be ſory and lament for the contrary, namely for their iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or for the auerſnes of others from vs.</p>
               <p>In all which, albeit ſinne may ſeeme but to haue a little ſhare,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:14934:220"/>and that to conſent and belong, holden in theſe, ſeemes not to be deadly, yet ſo great dammage is hereby brought vnto the ſoule, as he well knoweth it, who ſeckes God from the heart. For from hence it is, that the ſoule is blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and dulled, and made heauy and lumpiſh to all good things. Therefore he that would be euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more the Lord and Maſter of his actes and a potent man in Gods fauour, ſo that he may eaſily doe the will of God, muſt by and by reſiſt the firſt motions of his will, deſiring and affecting iniuries, labours, ſorrowes, contempt and euery kinde of contradiction which offers it ſelfe, reſiſting ſuch appetite of ſorrow and griefe which in the firſt motion offers it ſelfe for ſuch iniuries and the like.</p>
               <p>And on the other ſide, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering honors, mens fauours, and all ſuch things as are ſweete and delightfull to the fleſh, which mooue in vs any complacency,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:14934:221"/>or liking, we muſt be ready, that in our will we may bring fourth the act of not deſiring ſuch things as we naturally couet: for ſo doing we ſhal firſt ſhu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſin &amp; vanity, &amp; by often doing, obtaine moſt excellent habit, all wicked habits being expulſed. And albeit that often our euill habits and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes makes it difficult to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that which is good; or not to affect the euill; yet being in our power, as I haue ſaid, albeit at the beginning weake acts are produced, yet muſt wee not bee ſlacke to bring fourth ſuch acts, for by little and little they will gather ſtrength, and bring no ſmall benefit to the ſoule.</p>
               <p>For euer as he that giues him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the ſtudy of grammer, if he at firſt learne but to decline a nowne, he thinkes he hath done no great thing, but as he goes on and learne to decline diuerſe, at the end of the yeare hee will both vnderſtand, and ſpeake al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all things, and ſo much the
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:14934:221"/>better, the ſecond and third yeares, and ſo at length will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a perfect grammarian, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if euery day with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and care of memory and vnderſtanding he apply himſelfe to the ſtudy, all which care and indeuour is very needfull to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come perfect: ſo in this moſt ſoueraigne art of ſeruing God, how much more neceſſary is it to imploy all our wits and time, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which knowledge, not one onely habit but many are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as the habit of the loue of God and man, chiefely our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, the habit of humility, Patience and abſtinence, euery one of which requires more time to learne then grammer, ſeeing in our ſoules are rooted ſundry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther habits contrary to theſe; which neuer falleth out in him that learneth grammer or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſcience.</p>
               <p>Yet obſerue, that by how much as the acts which the will produceth are more vehement
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:14934:222"/>and frequent, by ſo much ſooner are habits acquired, as it falls out betwixt two of vnequall wit, that the one profits more in a yeere, then the other in two, applies his ſtudy with al his power, the other labours but little therein. And we call that a vehement act, as when one is iniuried, or deſpiſed without any precogitation, or pre-conceiued imagination ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. If then wee incline the will ſtrongly, ſo much to deſire this, as that wee ſhould reioyce at it, whereby through ſuch ioy the ſoule might he tamed againſt that which it firſt loued, againſt the will of God: this we call a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment act.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, honor and fauour of men being offered vs, if then we puiſſantly incline the will to turne away from theſe things becauſe ſuch fauour and honour might be impediments to contempt and direction which is the way to humility; which God ſo much loueth. Such acts are of
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:14934:222"/>ſo great efficacy that a few ſuch would produce an excellent ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of humility and patience: and ſo may we ſay of other vertues.</p>
               <p>But aboue all, our frailty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that we labour with great ſorrow, we roote vp vices out of the ſoule. And we doe not onely kill the roote of vices, that great one of ſinne brought foorth and practiſed, but euery ſmall incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation which wee feele in our ſelues to ſinne, is the roote of ſin, moouing vs to doe ſo againſt that which the Goſpell commandeth vs. Therefore we muſt ſtriue to ſtrangle theſe inclinations, as the children of the moſt high God with all our power. For albeit ſuch rootes are deeply planted in the ſoule, yet by frequent acts at length we ſhall ſo extirpate them from the land of out fleſh, euen as we are wont daily to roote vp out of the earth, the roots of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall plants.</p>
               <p>For ſuch rootes are not eradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated and vnrooted at one two or
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:14934:223"/>three blowes, but by many and frequent ſtrong atchieuements and labours: but by many more labours, is one vicious habit to be diſplanted, for it hath laide his roots much lower and more fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly both in the body and minde.</p>
               <p>This inſtruction may ſeeme to conteine nothing but dry and barren words, but ſuch doe the grounds of all acts and ſciences ſeeme to be: yet of ſuch great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit is this inſtruction, that this alone ſufficeth to teach vs the manner and reaſon of doing well, albeit all other meanes were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne. And it is ſo neceſſary withall, to be knowne, and fully vnderſtood, as it is neceſſary for him that would make a ſtrong and ſtable building to know and haue a ſure foundation. And it ſhould bee in vaine to hope for vertue in an eminent degree by the ordinary way, this way being neglected.</p>
               <p>For want whereof many haue
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:14934:223"/>laboured but without fruit, as it falleth out in many affayres of the worlde, whilſt a due and direct order is not obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, which is the life of euery action.</p>
               <p n="7">7 <hi>Inſtruction.</hi> That there is a way of planting good habites in the ſoule and rooting out the euil: and that by the foreſaide inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: and withall, that it is the office of humility to bee igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant whether wee haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained theſe good habites, and withall the grace and fauour of God.</p>
               <p>Hee that would rightlie ſerue ſo great a Lord as GOD is, preſuppoſing that the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ruine of the ſoule con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in euill habits, and the repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in good, which regularly are produced by many acts, or a few but thoſe vehement &amp; ſtrong; muſt conſider that ſeeing all ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits are placed in the ſoule, the acts alſo by which they are therein produced are principallie
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:14934:224"/>done by the inſtruments of the ſoule, albeit ſometimes they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue helpe from that which is corporall.</p>
               <p>As for the point: a man deſires to build a houſe that might giue him contentment, money he hath yea and alſo materials ready pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared: but yet how long ſoeuer he ſhall thinke on this buſineſſe, or deſire it, he ſhall neuer obtaine it, vntill he begin to worke, and ioyne one materiall to another, as is required in building of hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. So if a man be impatient and deſirous to correct it in himſelfe and obtaine the habit of patience; although he be iniuried both by word and deed, although hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the habite of patience, yea al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he bridle his mouth from words, and reſtraine his hands from reuenge, yet ſhall he neuer get the habit of patience, except he helpe himſelfe, chiefly by the inwards of the ſoule; often moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his vnderſtanding to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, the great benefit of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:14934:224"/>and inclining his will as the inſtrument neceſſary for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing thereof, to affect and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire iniuries and perſecutions for the loue of God, and our redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, who exhorts vnto ſuch things, and ſuffered ſuch things for our ſakes. And ſuch a habit is thus to be produced, as in the ſixt inſtruction we heard.</p>
               <p>Thou offerſt to the thought of thy vnderſtanding this obiection; what wilt thou doe, if ſuch or ſuch an iniury (namely ſuch as thou abhorreſt) were done vnto thee. Suddenly from the euill ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit that is in thee, there ariſeth in thy minde a certaine horror of this iniury. Therefore preſently call to mind, the great good which accrues vnto thee by the ſufferance of this iniury and the like, and thou ſhalt bind thy will to deſire ſuch things, nor ſhalt thou leaue thus to bind thy ſelfe vnto it, albeit that it ſeem wholly to be conſtrained: for there is euer ſome voluntarineſſe in it, and ſo
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:14934:225"/>often ſhalt thou produce ſuch acts, that, that may increaſe which ſeemed ſcarce to be voluntary, that thou maiſt voluntarily ſuffer iniuries, and that this habit may be planted in thee. And this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample may ſerue alſo to plant the habits of other vertues: namely by conſidering the great good of theſe vertues, and compelling the will vnto them. And if thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that it is the will of GOD, that thou ſhouldeſt be auerſe from all filthy pleaſures of the fleſh, and compell thy will neuer to deſire them, not ſo much as in thought to dwell vpon them, albeit it be but for ſome ſmall time, thou maiſt in fewe daies attaine to an excellent habit of chaſtity.</p>
               <p>And thus may one bee inrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all holy habits. But wee may obſerue, that (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) if by the onely praecogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of an iniurie, one may gaine the habit of patience, much ſooner and better may it bee held, if indeede iniurie bee
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:14934:225"/>done one, or anie other thing, wherewith wee ſeemed before men to bee confounded and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſed, ſo that wee compell the will to deſire the ſame. For the actes of the will receiuing this iniurie are more vehement, and ſo doe more tame the Soule, then are thoſe of the will one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie deſiring, or receiuing an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie onely in cogitation offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, namely by thinking that it ſhall, or may chance.</p>
               <p>A fewe vehement actes doe worke more ſtrongly and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuallie to produce a habit, then manie remiſſe, which hee muſt verie well obſerue, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to bee one of Almightie GODS moſt chiefeſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants.</p>
               <p>For hee muſt neither ſay, or thinke that hee will doe what in him is to obtaine the grace of GOD and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther benefits of his, who doth not alſo wiſh and withall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in himſelfe whileſt thoſe
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:14934:226"/>things are offred to him by which he may be the better diſpoſed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, ſeeing theſe are ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the diſcerning of vices and increaſe of vertues, to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of perfect charity, in which conſiſts all the good and perfect obedience of God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to this end it is very expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to keepe the will very firme and ſtedfaſt, in the deſire and loue of God, and hatred of euill: to which purpoſe it will not bee a little auaileable to ponder the conſiderations and reaſons, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of bookes exhorting to deuotion are full, namely, why God is to be loued and euill deteſted.</p>
               <p>But yet let not this be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, to the end that wee may euer be reſtrained with the bridle of feare, from falling into pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous ſinnes; that albeit one may haue gained moſt excellent habits of vertues, yet is hee not thereby ſecured, that he hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the true good, namely the grace of God: which albeit hee
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:14934:226"/>aſſuredly hath, whilſt hee hath theſe things which we here ſpeak of and ſhall ſpeake, yet can wee neuer naturally know when wee haue theſe things, in the manner that the will of God is we ſhould haue them, and ſo we cannot be certaine that wee haue obtained the grace and fauour of God. But it is very apparent, and a principal ſigne we haue gained it, is, when we ſo in our minds handle the vertues whereof we haue gotten the habit, as we thinke of other mens vertues: namely that thence our heart ſhould not be more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled, but bleſſe God and giue him thanks, who is the authour of euery good gift, and equally to reioyce for theſe as well as the other, for the praiſe and glory of God, which is equally manifeſted in the one and the other. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that we may not caſt the ſalt of our ſloth vpon the things that are here written; it muſt be conſidered, that if any ſeeme to endeauour to gaine ſome of the
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:14934:227"/>things which are here ſaid that ought to bee done, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not attaine them: hee may know, that this befalleth him becauſe hee i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So this being don he muſt decke himſelfe with ſuch habits and vertues, as may make him appeare beautifull and grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in his ſight. Which is to bee performed by theſe exerciſes following.</p>
               <p n="1">

               <p>He that hath offended ſo great a Lord as is our God, by ſuch grieuous treacheries as wee haue done, &amp; would now againe come into his ſeruice: it is meet that firſt he labour to get his offence par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, &amp; that to doe this hee vſe thoſe meanes whereby he may more eaſily be reſtored to grace: and that we may not as deſperate perſons, or conceited ideots thinke that no remedy is to bee found for ſo great a malady as that of our malice, the diuine goodneſſe euer deſirous of our
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:14934:228"/>good hath prouided for vs an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie remedy, namely that we ſhold be ſorry for our heinous proditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and offences which we haue committed againſt his goodneſſe, and no ſooner ſhall we intimou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly from the heart conceiue this ſorrow, but by &amp; by all our wie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe ſhall be blotted out of his memory.</p>
               <p>So great is the malice and poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſinne, that to the extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing and putting out of the ſame, not all the ſorrow and tears of all men in the world is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of it ſelfe; how much leſſe the ſorrow and teares of one man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone? but yet ſo great is the cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meney and mercy of our Lord, and of ſuch, value is the vnualua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble price of the pretious blood of the ſonne of God, that he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſo that we repent our ſinnes with a ſincere heart, and with a liuely faith apply that pretious merits of that ſpotleſſe Lambe of God to our wounded ſoules, to ſupply in mercy what is defectiue
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:14934:229"/>in our weakeneſſe, and to accept that all ſufficient ſacrifice of his bleſſed Sonne vpon the Croſſe for a complete and full ranſome and ſatisfaction for all.</p>
               <p>And ſurely it is but iuſt and right, that wee grieue for our ſinnes committed, for there is no man lyuing who is not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally greeued, and doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pene that hee hath done any act, whereby either harme may enſue vnto him, or he may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of any good thing that hee affected. Now ſinne is the cauſe that wee looſe that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite good, euren GOD him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: it is the cauſe that grace is taken from vs, wherein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts all our riches, it is the cauſe that wee become Sathans ſeruants, and GODS ſworne enemies, it is the cauſe that hee that dieth in it, ſhall for euer bee depriued of, the inheritance of heauen, and buried in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernall dennes, and iuſtly ought hee to ſuffer ſo great euill, who
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:14934:229"/>commits Treaſon againſt the moſt ſupreme GOD, who was content to die, that hee might giue vnto vs life. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the euills wherewith ſinne affects vs, were to number the drops of heauen in a ſtorme of raine.</p>
               <p>Therefore our ſorrow for ſins ought to be longer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any words can reach, ſeeing our GOD of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, is ſo good and ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of our ſeruice, and neuer to bee offended: whoſe anger and offence ought moſt to vrge vs, and: whoſe will and goodneſſe, aboue all things to mooue vs to blot out our ſinnes with the ſobs of our hearts, and teares of our ſoules, that being put out of his ſight, that deuine goodneſſe may be pleaſed with our lame o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</p>
               <p>But the maner of acquiring this ſorrow, if the heart bee found to bee harde, is, that wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent to the Soule, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill that proceeds from ſinne
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:14934:230"/>and compell our will to deſire that it were not committed, and that God had not been offended by it. And this act of the will we muſt labour often to produce, ſometimes generally for all ſinne, ſometimes diſcourſing from one ſinne to another, and with the greateſt endeauour we can, albeit ſometimes we may ſeeme to haue no ſenſible griefe; for ſuch is not in our power, nor is abſolutely neceſſary at all times: God in whoſe hands it is will giue it vs, if we often aſſume that which we can obtaine: and in this ſorrow he that will rightly begin to ſerue God, muſt continue a month or more.</p>

But becauſe ſuch kind of hatred ſeems at the firſt ſight to defer vs from this exerciſe, for the inbred loue which euery one hath towards themſelues aboue all things in the world, vnto which alſo euery man is bounde,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> we will firſt ſhew the manner how euery one ought to hate himſelfe:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore euery one ought to hate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: and thirdly how this hatred can ſtand with true charity which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> begins at the loue of ones ſelfe.</p>
               <p>I Preſuppoſing the rule and Canon of the ſixt inſtruction, the manner, wherewith euery one ought to hate himſelfe, muſt bee this, that he neither will, deſire nor aſſume to himſelfe any thing that may delight him beſides that which without the offence of God he cannot omit, but if he muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it and take it to him, then it muſt be ſo done, that as much as in him is, he be ſorry for it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſidering
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:14934:231"/>how vnworthy hee is of all delectation and pleaſure in reſpect of his ſinnes, and thereupon is ſorry that he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to admit it, yet in as much as it is the pleaſure of God, he willingly and ioyfully admits it. As for the purpoſe, eating, drinking, &amp; the like, which bring ſome delectation with them, thou muſt neuer aſſume, will or deſire them for thy owne comforts and delights, or to ſatisfie thy owne appetite, nay thou muſt with a firme will determine with thy ſelfe, that thou wouldeſt not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it, if the will of God were not ſuch as would haue thee to doe it, To hold this firme reſolution, it is needfull that thou call to minde the ſixt inſtruction.</p>
               <p>And herein ſhalt thou know that thou hall gained ſuch a will, when thou takeſt onelie ſo much of theſe, and in that manner as thou thinkeſt God would haue thee to take and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. God would that thou
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:14934:231"/>ſhouldeſt take of meate and drinke what is neceſſarie both in quantitie and qualitie. In quantitie, ſo much as is truely and not fainedlie neceſſarie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee whereby thou maiſt bee diſpoſed and made ſtrong to the ſeruice of GOD: in quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that with all thy power thou reiect all ſweete taſte therein, except when it is neceſſarie for the remedie of thy infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</p>
               <p>In theſe and the like it will be euer expedient, that wee take ſomething leſſe, yea whilſt yet it may ſeeme neceſſarie vnto vs to take ſo much. For often the too much loue of our ſelues will impoſe vpon vs, but ſeldome the hatred of our ſelues.</p>
               <p>Beſides it is neceſſarie toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with this hatred of thy ſelfe, that thou doeſt now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire all the toyles, vexations, contempts &amp;c iniuries to be done thee, which be wiſhed, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired &amp;c aſſumed, ſo that it be not

So this is neceſſary the caution, diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and counſail of ſome wiſe and holy man, and a continuall feare that vnder the colour of good, we be not deceiued.

               <p>It is alſo beſides neceſſary, if we will worthily hate our ſelues, not onely to leaue all delectable things, and withall deſire all gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uances and vexations, but withall we muſt herein reioyce, when any ſuch aduerſities and priuations of pleaſant things, nay of neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry things befal vs from any, which is more greeuous vnto vs then whilſt we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="385" facs="tcp:14934:232"/>and malicious intent.</p>
               <p>And albeit we cannot without manifeſt ſignes iudge hereof, nor yet then with any firme reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And albeit we ought much to lament the offence of the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuter and wrong doer, louing him in the bowels of compaſſion as one from whom we haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a ſingular benefit: yet when we ſhall manifeſtly ſee it, we muſt bee very carefull that ſo great a gift &amp; pretious pearle periſh not; but conſidering the reaſons wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore euery one muſt hate himſelfe, as we ſhall ſhew anon, then muſt our will come on producing moſt frequent acts of deſiring and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting ſuch perſecution and contempt which is done vnto vs: which things when we haue done we ſhall be inriched with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hatred which we looke for.</p>
               <p>All theſe things Chriſt Ieſus our Maſter hath both by word and example taught vs, whoſe moſt holy ſoule, albeit neuer wounded with the ſting of any
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:14934:233"/>ſinne, and ſo there being no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of handling that pretious body with any aſperity of hatred, yet would hee for our example, deſpiſe all delectable things and ſuffer perſecution and to bee ſo euill intreated as neuer was any other man. All which hee did, that wee might learne what wee ought to doe, to obtaine this ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of our ſelues which is ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. Seeing then his Maieſty would ſuffer ſuch things, by his example to induce vs to the like, Chriſt ſuffring for vs,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.</note> and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vs an example to follow his ſteps: Let vs for the loue of God open our eyes and behold if it bee iuſt, that our GOD and Lord ſhould ſuffer ſo much for our ſinnes, and to our inſtruction, ſo many iniuries, indignities, and perſections, whileſt we caſting off all ſhame, forſake him, and not onely not in act beare any kinde of puniſhment or iniury for his ſake, but not ſo much as to haue will to ſuffer it, nor yet euer
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:14934:233"/>meditate or deſire it, and much leſſe that any man ſhould ſpeake to vs of it. Surely as it would be ridiculous, if any did deſire to be called a ſtudent in Diuinity, or to be accounted a Diuine, which is neither exerciſed in that ſtudy, nor yet is deſirous to know any principle of it: ſo is it ridiculous that any ſhould eſteeme himſelfe the ſeruant of God, or be in any religious congregation, which is the ſchoole of all vertues, who labours not to procure and haue this holy hatred, chiefely hauing ſo excellent a Maſter to teach it vs.</p>
               <p>Let them conſider this, who are ſo negligent in religion that they thinke all Chriſtian duties to be but matter of conformity, and let them know that the name of Chriſtians agrees not to them, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they ſtudy the doctrine of ſo ſublime a ſearcher, deliuered vnto vs both by word and example. And ſurely, if nothing elſe would driue vs to this care, but only that
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:14934:234"/>we might imitate ſo great a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter as the Sonne of God, and be made like him, euen that might ſuffice, without any other reaſon, to make vs walke the iourney, which ſo worthy a Maſter hath troden out for vs, ſeeing wee are ſure that he cannot there erre in the way, nor hath loſt the crowne of glory.</p>
               <p>But that wee may more fully obtaine this thing, one thing is to be noted, which at the firſt bluſh may ſeeme to be of ſmal moment, but more aduiſedly conſidered, will be thought of much worth, Namely, that the chiefe exerciſe moſt expedient for vs to vſe, for the gayning of this holy hatred, is, that inceſſantly we purſue and aſſault thoſe our innumerable ſmall deſires, which euery mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment occur. And the manner of purſuing them is after the faſhion of thoſe who indeauor to ſet vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a potent aduerſary by deceits. For with great circumſpection wee muſt prouide, whether hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:14934:234"/>wee deſire any thing which is not of GOD, nor leads vs vnto GOD, and aſſoone as we perceiue that anything falls out that may delight vs beſides and without GOD, ſuddenly the will is to bee inclined to contradict it, and not to accept it, But aſſoone as wee ſhall ſee any thing befall vs contrari<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>at, or diſpleaſant to vs, by and by, to incline the will to deſire that. Which if any ſhall frequently exerciſe, hee ſhall farre ſooner obtaine this holy hatred, and withall ſo great dominion ouer himſclfe, as cannot be in words expreſſed. For it is moſt certaine, that this is the key of all thoſe treaſures belonging to perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="2">2 For what cauſe wee muſt hate our ſelues: is now to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed. Which albeit, may ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently bee grounded out of theſe aſſertions of our Sauiours, <hi>Hee that hates not his owne ſoule cannot bee my Diſciple,</hi>

<pb n="397" facs="tcp:14934:238"/>procure it: but more happy he, who ſeeing himſelfe in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of the conflicts of perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and worldly diſaſters and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, ſhall yet ſwallow thoſe bitter draughts, that hee may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe this loue of God, and that hatred of himſelfe: but moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py is he, who through long exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe is ſo directed towards the greatneſſe of this moſt ſweet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, that albeit, for his naturall inclination, it brings great paine with it, yet the ardent deſire of increaſing in the loue of God, doth change it into ſo great ſweetneſſe, as that was wont to doe, which with a moſt earneſt longing, he before deſired.</p>
               <p>Of the manner, in reſpect of our duety, whereby to obtaine this, ſhalbe ſpoken in the ſixth exerciſe of humility which is the primary foundation hereof: Yet this place requires, that wee ſhould deliuer the moſt effectuall manner of obtayning this hatred of our ſelues becauſe the thing is
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:14934:239"/>ſo out of all practiſe and vſe. Therefore we muſt obſerue, that it is very expedient we be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, that at what time the will is inclined to deſire or accept per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, it is not fit to bring into ſight the perſecution it ſelfe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling our ſelues to accept it: for it is ſomething difficult, volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to accept perſecution, being preſent or but lately laide on vs, except wee haue a great meaſure of the annointing of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: therefore we muſt doe thus, vſing a holy caution. It falleth out often, that we are iniuried and that without all reaſon, much griefe accompanying it. Behold now we are at the point of death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For at that time, ſenſuality hath no life but is wholy ſubiected: the miſerable reaſon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>is not then miſtreſſe as it ought, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionats ſenſuality as her ſiſter, albeit aduerſant: the deuill who is neuer a ſleepe, indeauours by all his michinations, to inflame vs, that we might the more feele
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:14934:239"/>the perſecucion: yet God who is faithfull,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.</note> will not ſuffer vs to bee tempted aboue our ſtrength. Now it behoueth vs to ſee what on our behalſe we can and ought to doe, with, Gods aſſiſtance, in ſuch a danger.</p>
               <p>Namely, that the iniury being ſo preſent &amp; nere vnto vs, as much as is in vs, for ſome ſhort time, we forget the ſame, and for this time, to lift vp the eyes of our conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, to thinke on thoſe innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable riches contained in the loue of God towards vs, and with this conſideration we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the will to loue and deſire the infinit good of this loue: ſo as now louing and deſiring ſo great riches, we turne our ſelues and incline our wills to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent perſecution, before as it were forgotten, and reputing it to bee ſo neceſſary, (as wee haue ſaid) to obteine the riches of Gods loue; we deſire the ſame with all our might, inforcing the will with all our power to deſire it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="400" facs="tcp:14934:240"/>
Thus, no doubt, the will being mollified, and ſtrenghthned with the reward of the loue of God and future glory, will bee moſt ready to be inclined and drawne to accept ſuch perſecution, which before was ſo terrible in our eyes, and if wee exerciſe this often, wee ſhalbe ſo accuſtomed to that which is good, that what before ſeemed aboue nature, wee ſhall now with great delight per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme. And this would be againe and againe conſidered: becauſe it is of great moment aſwell to the whole Chapter, as that of Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Patience, Affections of the ſoule, as alſo that of the loue of our ſelues, and againe to any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty or labour inward or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, &amp; to conclude, to the whole method of ſeruing God.</p>

And this loue ſuffers not the co-partnerſhip of any vice, albeit we are inclined to it, and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying our ſelues and hating our ſelues and taking from our ſelues the euill that we deſire, we are filled with the true diuine loue: which otherwiſe we could neuer inioy.</p>

               <p n="1">1 Of prayer. Our moſt high and omnipotent God would haue vs ſtand in need of his ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall helpe, ſeeing the good things vnto which he hath created vs, are ſupernaturall. And he would alſo that we ſhould call vpon him for them, not but that he more deſireth to giue vs them then wee to aske them of him, but that we might poſſeſſe that with greater glory, which we obtaine with greater labour of deſire. Beſides he would haue vs aske, that as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate ſuiters we ſhould more frequently preſent our ſelues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and ſo by often preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our ſelues in his preſence, might the better come into the knowledge of him. For by how much we haue the thing preſent before vs, by ſo much the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:14934:242"/>of it maketh the greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion: and the better we know his greatneſſe and ſuper-eminent qualities, we ſhall the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioice in him; and the more we ſhal reioice in him and know him, the more we ſhall loue him; and by how much as we ſhall know him and loue him more, by ſo much more will the beames of truth ſhine in our ſoules: and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, by how much as this light together with his loue ſhall ſhine in vs, by ſo much more, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is not good or tending to God, ſhall be nothing reputed in our eyes, and by ſo much more ſhall we hate that is euill, imbrace all vertue and come neere vnto God.</p>
               <p>From whence it is cleere by many reaſons, that prayer is a ſure iourney to obtaine whatſoeuer is neceſſary for vs, and that it leades vs to the height of loue, to which we were borne. Therefore we muſt eſteeme this prayer or that neceſſitie of
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:14934:243"/>prayer, as a pledge which God hath taken of vs, whereby to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vs with him. For hee knowes well, how much good comes vnto vs by his preſence, and how aſſuredly we would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get him, if wee had no need of him.</p>
               <p>Now we muſt know, that the excellency of praier, that it may bee imperious and commaund a bleſſing, doth not onely conſiſt herein, that wee demaund ſome excellent thing, but with all and much more, that wee haue a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limated and high motiue and ſcope. And the motiue that ſhould ſet vs to pray muſt bee, to beleeue that our Lord GOD would, that we ſhould haue what wee aske: and, he would haue vs to aske, that wee might thereby bee diſpoſed to his ſeruice. For bleſſed is the bread which hee eates, who eateth to this end that hee might liue, and liuing might be imploied in increaſing in the loue of the glory of his God. For
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:14934:243"/>ſo the asking of bread, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer elſe with a ſuch motiue, is much eſteemed in the ſight of God. Beſides, of ſuch a minde we muſt bee, that if wee thinke it not acceptable vnto GOD, that we obtaine that which wee moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, forthwith, as much as is in vs, wee muſt neither deſire nor aske it.</p>
               <p>The hungry ſoule for the moſt part by the famine that oppreſſeth him, is mooued to aske bread, but ſo is not hee who rightly praies vnto GOD, hee muſt aske meat and neceſſary grace and glory, not chiefely for that he hath need of theſe, but for that the Lord God would that wee ſhould haue them, expecting onely our prayer that hee might giue them vnto vs; ſo that the will of GOD deſirous that wee ſhould haue theſe things, muſt more mooue vs to aske and deſire our owne good, then the ioy and glorie which wee hope, may accrue vnto vs thereby.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="408" facs="tcp:14934:244"/>
Therefore the manner of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ought to bee, that our ſoule hauing attained to a habit of asking that which God deſires aboue any other things, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed by many acts of ſo asking it, not chiefly for our owne good, but for that his moſt Holy will is moſt worthy to bee deſired a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all deſireables; whatſoeuer we ſhall aske, let it be immixt and interwouen with ſuch a habit, and all the words of our prayers let them bee ioyned to the actes of willing; and deſiring whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer we ſhall aske, for this cauſe that God deſireth that wee ſhould haue it, whereby wee might thus become his more acceptable ſeruants, and haue the greater loue towards him. Happy are they that can thus pray, for in few daies they ſhall grow to bee po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent men in the Lord. To per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme all the foreſaid things, are neceſſary the 2. and 6. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions.</p>
               <p>I will hereof giue this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:14934:244"/>For many doe pray with the ſome motiue; yet ſpeed not for the purpoſe: ſome man asketh ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>d grant to ſome good end, knowing that GOD hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded vs to aske of, him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries. Hee askes inſtantly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging his owne vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe: perſeuers in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of asking and feeles in his prayer ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>dſte of ſweetneſſe and diuine loue. Now ſome thinke this prayer to proceede from a perfect motiue and ſcope, but it is not ſo; albeit the prayer bee deuout and good. But if you aske what it wants, I anſwere there is this wanting, that hee asked not of loue, albeit with loue. Therefore I ſay it ſufficeth not, that the motiue be perfect, that hee loue, and haue all other things, but he muſt alſo be moued to aske of loue, and not for the loue of the thing deſired, albeit yet euen the loue of the thing may be kept with much perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: ſo that in act it be reſired to
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:14934:245"/>this, that therefore it may be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, becauſe God will that wee ſhould loue that thing, which now is not ſo in the former kind, and therefore exceeds the bounds of prayer.</p>
               <p>Therefore many conſidering this, haue come to know, that the loue of themſelues was hid vnder the ſhadow of the loue of God, and that it was true, that albeit they loued GOD, yet were they not mooued with this loue in act whileſt they prayed, but with the loue of themſelues, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit not with an ill loue, whereby they were mooued to aske that which they did, becauſe it was good. This will be more eaſily vnderſtood by that which often falls out amongſt ſuch as loue one another; that one askes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of another, and that with the loue wherewith hee loueth him, yet not of, or for the loue which hee hath towards him, of whom hee asketh: but for the loue of himſelfe and his owne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit.
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:14934:245"/>Therefore, as before is ſaid, wee muſt not aske ſo of God, but we muſt aske with and for his loue; that is, we muſt actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally perceiue a deſire of obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that we aske, whereby God by that may receiue from vs an acceptable obedience; ſurely great and neceſſary is the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that we may know the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of theſe loues. For it is a thing neceſſary to bee knowen, and many thinke they haue gone aright in this buſineſſe, but look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neerer into the thing they haue found it to bee onely the imagination of the true loue of GOD, and themſelues to be far from it indeed.</p>
               <p>Hee therefore beleeues and knowes himſelfe to bee in the right way, who continually builds, as vpon his guide in the way, vpon an actuall deſire of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyning by prayer, theſe or theſe graces, that God may reioyce to ſee him ſo beautified, and that hee may grow in his loue.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="412" facs="tcp:14934:246"/>
And although at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this exerciſe, many ſhall not only feele that they do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in deuotion, but rather to haue made ſhip-wracke of that which they had before, for which they ſhall be much grieued in their ſoules: yet let them goe on cheerefully in this great worke. And let them not admire that they feele this diminution of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for in that he finds in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe this coldneſſe and indeuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hee ſhall performe a farre more worthie duety, then before, whileſt he ſeemed to taſte a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſweetneſſe and contentment.</p>
               <p>For this contentment was wont to ariſe from the loue of himſelfe, albeit not euill, which yet is to be abandoned, that one may bee wholly addicted to the loue of God which is beſt of all. For when it aroſe from the loue of our ſelues which was very great, we found great ſweetneſſe and pleaſure in it: but that loue being diſcarded, the loue of God
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:14934:246"/>aboue entertained, which at the beginning is but ſmall, little ſweetneſſe and deuotion is felt; but this loue increaſing, the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and deuotion will alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.</p>
               <p>For illuſtration whereof, our owne experience will ſerue. Wee ſee that two ſtickes doe burne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the one being drier and eaſily fiered, the other not ſo, yet the firing of the one, makes the other being greene, and not ſo apt to burne, to flame and as it ſelfe doth: but if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue them aſunder, you ſhall finde that ſticke which was not ſo drie, to looſe both his flame and heate too: and to keepe it from going quite out, hee muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced either to vſe the bellowes, or elſe re-match it with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer which firſt ſet it on fire. In like manner, our loue of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not ſo hot and inflamed of it ſelfe, if yet it be ioyned to the loue of our ſelues, which is like drie wood, it will as tinder ſet on fire
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:14934:247"/>all our workes, but being diuor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from this loue of our ſelues, the loue of GOD will ſtand in need of the bellowes of many ſtrong labours and actions to keepe it in.</p>
               <p>For ſcarcely ſhall wee find any flame of this loue, but rather ſeeme in our ſelues to bee key cold: and therefore by many ſtrong acts muſt wee ſuccour it, by the conſideration of thoſe things, which according to the loue of our ſelues ſeemed ſweete vnto vs; namely by the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the great good of glory and comforts which wee hope for in time to come, and againe, that ſo wee ſhall eſcape thoſe great euills which wee doe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally abhorre and hate. And by ſuch breathings &amp; blaſts of the loue of our ſelues, we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that ſome little flame of the loue of God may bee inkindled, and by little and little gather ſtrength &amp; increaſe, according to the proportion of our indeauour,
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:14934:247"/>being helped thereunto by the loue of God.</p>
               <p>Yet it is very expedient, that wee indeauour earneſtly to haue ſtrong acts in all the things af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, whereby that ſo vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a loue of GOD may bee produced in vs; as that was wont to bee which we had before, as a loue compounded of the loue of our ſelues which was great, vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and contentfull, together with the loue of God, which was but ſmall and very weake. And this wee muſt labour to doe, till wee finde ſo great ſweetneſſe in being deliuered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our ſtreights and miſeries, onely to the end that wee may the better ſerue God, as we were wont to feele whileſt wee deſired the ſame, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced thereunto, onely that wee might be deliuered from the ang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſh that did ſo tire vs.</p>
               <p>He that ſhall dot thus, may worthily conceiue, that hee hath the true and ſincere loue of God which we ought euer to ſeeke &amp;

That therefore this may bee firme and fixed in euery mans heart by many acts of good conſideration in that conſiſts the key of humility, in deſiring, that thoſe which iniury vs and ſuch as ſee vs ſo iniuried, may thinke that we doe not ſuffer this out of humility, but becauſe wee cannot auoide it. For we cannot eſteeme it any great thing, when we deſire to bee ill intreated with deſpight, if wee thinke that thoſe who ſee it, doe iudge that wee ſuffer it out of humility, not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, nor feeling the iniury. For he that would pleaſe GOD,
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:14934:256"/>muſt indeauour to be accounted vile and abiect, not of an humble and modeſt minde.</p>
               <p>This is that which I ſay, that we ſhould ſo deſire to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vile of others, and to be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led as abiects, that we ſhould alſo wiſh that they ſhould alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether thinke wee were ſo hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led againſt our will, and that we take it very hardly and are much offended that we are ſo eſteemed and ſo dealt withall; when in truth wee reioyce for the holy hatred of our ſelues, which wee finde to be in vs. Yet we muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, that if any man were of ſo great vertue, that vſing no vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to himſelfe, he could wiſh that other men eſteemed him vile and not humble, ſuch a man for the edification of his neighbours might wiſh, that they did iudge that he ſuffered ſuch iniuries with ioy and not againſt his will, but for the loue of God and humility: and that ſhould be very heroicall humility and ſuch as the ſonne of
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:14934:256"/>God would haue vs learne of him.</p>
               <p>But ſeeing this humility is to be learned of our redeemer, let vs ſet it before our eyes as the rude and vnskilfull in painting vſe to put the example which in learning they deſire to imitate. This humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the ſonne of God, is inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable, yet will we according to our groſſe conceit, endeauour to know it: conſidering that when he was God infinite, and man moſt perfect, he would and with great ioy did chuſe to bee eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and intreated for the moſt abiect thing in the world, for thy ſake, ſuffring all kinde of iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and contumelies from the day of his birth, vntill he ſuffred moſt ignominious death, and all theſe things, not for that they were neceſſary for him, but that wee, who had ſo great neceſſity might learne the manner of humbling our ſelues, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in theſe ſaid things. Whence wee may ſee how reprehenſible
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:14934:257"/>he is, who doth not learne this humility, which ſo great a Maſter doth teach, and which hee exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in himſelfe, albeit not for himſelfe, but that we might learne of him. Therefore the humility of our Lord being knowne, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one ought to frame in his heart another humility: to the imitation and likeneſſe hereof, not that hee is commaunded to come to the equality thereof, for albeit all the creatures did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and reioyce to be accounted vile, and to bee moſt vnworthily intreated; out of the meane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit they had of themſelues from the true knowledge of their owne abiectneſſe and baſeneſſe; and if all the humility of all theſe were in one man; Yet this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility were nothing compared with our Redeemers humility. For many waies, there is infinit difference betwixt his Maieſtie and our nullity: euery of which puts infinit difference betwixt the excellency of his humility,
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:14934:257"/>and all the humility of all the Saints of God in one, &amp; therefore I ſaid that wee muſt frame our humility of the imitation and likeneſſe of his.</p>
               <p>Some may happily admire that God exacts of vs ſo great contempt of our ſelues and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and which coſt him ſo deare whileſt by his example hee taught it vs. Therefore wee may obſerue that it was his will ſo to doe, becauſe indeed it was good for vs, and becauſe wee haue no good thing of our ſelues, but all from his bountifull hand, whom wee ought to glorifie for it, and not our ſelues: And it is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good for vs, but moſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for ſuch humility is a perfect medicine for our deadly infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which proceeds from pride: nor ſhall euer any man be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly cured of it, but by humility. So much as ſhall want of the perfect cure of it, ſo much ſhall want of the clenſing of the ſoule; and how much we want of the
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:14934:258"/>clenſing of the ſoule, ſo much ſhall we want of the benefits and grace of God, and ſo much alſo ſhall we be leſſe his.</p>
               <p>And if any aske how one may reioyce to bee agitated and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moyled with contempts and wrongs, ſeeing it is a thing diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to deſire it. I anſwere that it may be done out of the great conſideration of this humility of the Sonne of God, and the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit ariſing vnto vs by it, and chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe we are ſo made able, that GOD may haue ioy in vs and an acceptable ſeruice of vs.</p>
               <p>But there is no diſceete man will caſt that from him, whereby the will of GOD may be fufil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led together with a mans own ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and ineſtimable and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall profit to himſelfe, and that with the labour of a moſt ſhort time.</p>
               <p>But that we may in reaſon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere this obiection: wee muſt note, that to frame ſo worthy an humility, it is neceſſary (as in the
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:14934:258"/>ſixth Inſtruction) that we often incline our will; and againe that wee often, nay daily deſire with ioy this ſo pretious an abiection and contempt. For how worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ought he to bee deſpiſed, who ſo often is found a Traitor againſt his eternall Lord and Sauiour, by ſinne betraying his ſoule to Sathan, and taking it from him who of his onely goodneſſe would die for it?</p>
               <p>Surely if ſeriouſly we thought on theſe things, with much griefe ſhould wee take honours if they were offered to vs; ſeeing wee cleerely know that hence it may fall out, that it may bee a hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to vs of moſt excellent good things, which by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of our ſelues and true hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility is the way to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen, doe vndoutedly remaine for vs. Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in ſome caſes, a man may wiſh to bee honoured and eſteemed, namely if hee haue the eye of his intention to ſome ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:14934:259"/>of God, which he beleeues or ſees, may by ſuch honor bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; but euen in that caſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, he muſt deſire with great cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, feare, and ſome griefe, to be honored.</p>
               <p>Now there is a certaine euill fruit and venemous hear be which growes plentifully in the world, ouer-growing and indeed ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing all vertues, but chiefly hindering the increaſe &amp; growth of humility, namely vaine glory the mother of all euill, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects all that is good in the whole man. And little or no vaine glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at all will offer it ſelfe to him that hath denied himſelfe and hates himſelfe in ſuch ſort as wee haue ſaid. For vaine glory is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a complacency and ioy that one takes, from that which he ought not to take it, or in that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he ought not to take it. Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may one reioyce of the good things he receiues of the hand of God, ſo farre fourth as he ſees or hopes that any ſeruice of God or
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:14934:259"/>benefit of his ſoule (for both are one if rightly vnderſtood) may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe therby. Elſe it is vaine ioy, and vaine glory: for we take vnto vs that glory, that is due to God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: or els we glory in our ſelues when we ſhold glory in the Lord.</p>
               <p>Therefore let euery man ſuſpect, that it is vaine &amp; not ſpiritual ioy which he takes of the benefits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, whileſt he reioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth not in the ſame maner, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the benefits which others haue receiued: for albeit we ought fiſtt chuſe good things for our ſelues before others, &amp; alſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioice (that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was not decreed that we together with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould obteine it, it fell out that wee had it) yet whileſt both wee and they obteine good things at the good hand of GOD, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Maieſty doth equally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce at both, nor ought our ioye to bee any other but in GOD, and for that his holy will is fulfilled. Thus reioiced the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the bleſſed Virgin in God
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:14934:260"/>her ſaluation. Our good GOD would haue vs ſo much to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce of euery good thing wee haue, as we know the ſame good to come from God, and to ſerue for the ſeruice of GOD. And when it exceeds this ordination of God, and goes beyond theſe bounds, then preſently becomes it vaine ioy and vaine glory.</p>
               <p>Yet farre worſe is the vaine glory, which ariſeth from the good thing wee haue not; but worſt of all is that, to reioyce at the euill he hath committed. So crafty is vaine glory that often he who is of ſmall vertue, will yet thinke himſelfe to reioyce in God for the good things he hath, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as yet for the moſt part it is mixt with vaine glory. Therefore vntill one be well aſſured of his vertues and graces, he ſhould euer flee all kinde of complacency and ioy, whileſt he recogitates the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of God which hee hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of God, or heareth of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and ſhould rather accuſtome
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:14934:260"/>himſelfe at thoſe times, to ſtand in feare, whereby ſhould, with a certaine griefe haue vaine glory in ſuſpition, which hiddenly is wont to riſe out of theſe things.</p>
               <p>Therefore omitting that worſt kinde of vaine glory as too groſſe to be entertained of any child of God, and is onely in the wicked, and ſuch as deſire not the true good: we will returne to the firſt vaine glory which ariſeth from that good which a man hath, doth, or heareth of himſelfe. The thing which may eaſily diſturne vs from ſo great an euill, is, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the mighty vanity &amp; falſity which may be found in it: for there is no man that is giuen to vertue, who doth not hate the thing which is vaine and falſe: &amp; ſo often and long may one conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this thing and that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that by much vſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering it, hee may conceiue ſo great a hatred againſt this euill of vaine glory, that thencefourth it will euer ſcarce offer it ſelfe to a
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:14934:261"/>man. And this is the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it were a vile and odious thing if any noble courtier ſhould eſteeme it for a great matter, and ſhould boaſt of it, that he had put himſelfe in ſome ſmall perill out of his loue and duety to the King, which King before that by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of him, and for the great loue he bare to him, had expoſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to many great daungers and wounds. But if the ſame noble man, ſhould not onely eſteeme that ſmall fauour he had done for his King, to whom hee ought ſo much, very highly; but alſo boaſt of it abroade, his leuity &amp; folly were worthy euery where to bee laughed at. But yet this vanity of his were much more abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable if the King himſelfe ſhould haue borne all this toile without all helpe of this noble man, and that the noble man ſhould haue ſuffred that little daunger with the great fauour, and helpe of the King, and with great promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and benefits before the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:14934:261"/>ſuffered, and after that little daunger ſuffred, largely perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
               <p>Into a vanity incomparably worſe doth he fall that followes vaine glory. For our moſt high God, a King of incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Maieſty, infinit power and glory, out of his onely goodneſſe, without any obligation behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our infinit neceſſity, for our reliefe, expoſed himſelfe to moſt bitter and ignominious death; in which buſineſſe wee were ſo farre from bringing him any helpe, that wee haue not beene thankful to him for it; nay all that were with him forſooke him, and wee doe moſt of all forſake him, through our defects and wants, albeit his Diuinity is now made knowne vnto vs much more then to any of them that forſooke him. Seeing then it is ſo, let vs acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge how vaine and wicked it is for any man to glory at the duety he performes to God, omitting in the meane time to glory in
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:14934:262"/>God alone, and how much more vaine it is, for this cauſe to deſire to be had in account with others, when all that time, wherein there hearts are occupied in iudging vs to be of much worth, they leaue to be imploied in eſteeming and praiſing God, the Author of all good. God forbid that the heart which is not exerciſed in highly eſteeming and praiſing the moſt high God, to whom all praiſe and glorie is due, ſhould be taken vp in eſteeming mee to be of any worth, to whom no ſuch thing, but ſhame and confuſion is due.</p>
               <p>Hee cannot but bee held for conſenting to the crime, who thinkes others doe occupy their mindes in praiſing and eſteeming him being ſo vile, in the meane time ceaſing to magnifie God for all his benefits: and yet is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſhamed nor grieued at ſuch inuerſion and abuſe of theſe things.</p>
               <p>And that which much increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our vanity, is, that whatſoeuer
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:14934:262"/>we doe or ſuffer, all that we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme is through Gods goodneſſe and the bounty of his hand, by whoſe ſingular helpe wee doe all that wee doe. And albeit ſome may ſay, that it is to euery man a thing glorious and of much worth, that he accepts this good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God, and doth not reiect the gifts and benefits of God, and ſo thinke that hence he may glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, herein to differ from the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, who therefore ſeeme to bee puniſhed, becauſe they accepted not the grace offred: to this may be anſwered that there was yet neuer any man the world, who vainely would boaſt hereof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, that he had accepted of the benefits done him by the King, but rather it ſhould be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted madneſſe not to accept of them, and that is the madneſſe of the damned, that they receiued not benefits of God when they might. But it is a fooliſh thing to reioice, that thou would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not be madde, elſe a man may
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:14934:263"/>goe preſumptuouſly and pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pompouſly, and being asked the cauſe why he doth ſo, he anſwers that he doth it for this cauſe, that when hee might haue beene a foole, and fallen into the pit, yet he would not: and that makes him aduance himſelfe, and thinke he is a iolly fellow. But ſuch a man in all mens iudgements would bee accounted a foole: How much more ſhold he of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſpeake. For euen this, that hee accepted the benefits or God, or did not reiect them, he hath chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the helpe of God; what haſt thou, that thou haſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued: and if thou haſt receiued it, why boaſteſt thou? Therefore he that conſidering this in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſhall boaſt himſelfe, is ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moſt madde and vaine, and voide of all good, ſo as much as he liſt, let him boaſt himſelfe, and glorie in ſuch his madneſſe.</p>

<pb n="439" facs="tcp:14934:264"/>ſo take theſe ſo daungerous wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons on his buckler, and defend himſelfe from them, that being wounded by none of them, hee may from euery one of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue a ſingular benefit and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to his ſoule, to the great glory of the King, in whoſe ſeruice hee fights: and that may thus be don. Firſt, from the firſt weapon and dart, he muſt withdraw his body by ſtepping aſide, inclyning his will, leaſt hee ſhould receiue the blow, conſenting to ſuch a iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and conſidering wee are prohibited by the chiefe Iudge, to whom onely it belongs, who ſaith, <hi>iudge not.</hi> Therefore wee muſt leaue that with great ioy, and not vſurpe his office. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, hee muſt receiue the ſecond Dart with all his forces, reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing at the iniury and griefe that proceeds from it; and by how much the more as he ſhall ſeeme to reioyce at it, by ſo much leſſe ſhall the deuill aſſault him by im patience, leaſt he ſhould giue him
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:14934:265"/>the occaſion of ſo great a good. And that it may thus fall out in this ſecond point haue recourſe to that which is written touching the hatred of our ſelues. Thirdly, wee muſt meete this third wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, namely of hatred againſt him of whom wee haue ſuſpition, or happily certaine knowledge, that hee ſpoke this; by inclining the will to produce ſome ſingular act of loue towards him, ſeeing (God aſſiſting vs) we may incline the will to deſire what it will, and to giue what end to our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours it will.</p>
               <p>And as wee ought to prouide our ſelues againſt theſe foreſaid three darts, ariſing from this ſmall occaſion, ſo ought wee to carry our ſelues towards all the fiery darts of men and diuells, which in all our liues doe occurre in any kinde of aduerſity, whereby wee may in all things ſo looke to our ſelues, that patience may euer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in our ſelues vnhurt, and that we may euer remember, that
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:14934:265"/>ſaying of Chriſts,<note place="margin">Luk. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>By your patience poſſeſſe your ſoules.</hi> Be ſure, that when hee ſhall haue determined, that patience ſhall haue poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in it, if that patience faile, the ſoule is left as it were deſtroied and forſaken: for neither ſhall it obtaine from God another poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor, if it ſuffer this to be taken from it, nor of it ſelfe can it haue any other that is good. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is it in the greateſt daunger that can be, leaſt it ſhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken captiue of euery one, ſeeing that roaring Lion neuer ſleepes, but euer goes about ſeeking whom hee may deuoure. From whoſe iawes onely ſuch poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, or thoſe that are poſſeſſed of patience are ſecure. Bleſſed therefore are the meeke and peacemakers, as that giuer of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe hath pronounced.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The third thing which wee noted to bee neceſſity for the beautifying of the ſoule,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> was that the affections reſident in euery man might bee brideled and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained.
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:14934:266"/>Theſe wee will reduce chiefly to theſe foure, ioy, ſorrow, hope and feare. Yet not omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to diſcourſe ſome thing of the reſt. For theſe are the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall affections which are found in euery of vs. For it is naturall for euery man to reioyce at preſent good things, to bee ſorrowfull for the euill, to hope for good to come, and feare the euill. Therefore here our labour muſt bee in ſpeaking of theſe affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſome others very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable to ſhew how they may warily be bridled and guided to the ſeruice of God.</p>
               <p>For much euill ariſeth from them, if they be ſuffred to goe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reined and at liberty, becauſe they neuer ceaſe rouing and running hither and thither in the ſoule, ſometimes this affection, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times that, ſo that hence it is that all the euills which befalls vs, doe ſpting in that. Wee ſuffer them without any check or ſnub to take their range: yea euen in
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:14934:266"/>men very deuout, they doe much harme, albeit they are much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined. But this is to be noted, that if any one doe all his workes both inword and outward for the loue of God, as in the 2. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and be led by a hated of himſelfe, as in the 2. Exerciſe is ſpoken, he ſhall with great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration reſtraine and gouerne theſe affections.</p>
               <p>Therefore here we will brieſly proceed, obſeruing that then are theſe affections ſaid to bee right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moderated, when we giue our aſſent to none of their motions in the minde, but ſuch as wee know doe pleaſe God, and from which he may receiue an accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſeruice: otherwiſe they ought euer to be baniſhed from his minde, that would ſafely tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile vnto God: as a learned man hath ſweetly reſolued.<note place="margin">Bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>That therefore wee may the more eaſily baniſh them: wee m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſt know, that all ioyes which the world affoords vs, are to bee placed in true euills; and that for the cauſe following. And hence it followeth, that all things which bring ſorrow and griefe are to bee placed and accounted amongſt true good things, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that by theſe, as by moſt wholeſome ſanatiues are cured the wounds of our ſoules. And ſurely he that rightly vnderſtands and performes theſe things may very eaſily doe that <hi>Boetius</hi> cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelleth, and which is in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſcourſed: to which that ſhall not a little helpe which is written in the 6.

               <p>
                  <pb n="445" facs="tcp:14934:267"/>
Yet wee will ſeuerally and briefly ſpeake of theſe affections beginning. 1. With ioy, where we muſt know, that we are to ioy in nothing but in God, and the things with are of God, ſuch are all the things that direct vs vnto God. The reaſon is: for he that hath ſo great matter of ioy in God and the things which are of God, is very in circumſpect, if in the meane time be occupie his mind in reioycing in any other thing, ſeeing our forces are ſo much weaker to reioyce and loue, by how much they are more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided and diſtracted into ſundry ioyes and buſineſſe. Wee ought alſo to know, that albeit we giue our ſelues wholy to GOD yet ſhall we not doe that we ought to doe, how much leſſe, if wee be diſtracted into other affaires? Therefore one of theſe things of neceſſity we muſt doe, either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell euery other ioy aſſoone as it inſinuats it ſelfe, to which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe wee muſt refort to the ſixth
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:14934:268"/>Inſtruction, or elſe that it be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered towards God, ſo it be not vaine ioye as in the 2. Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And that ſo our ioyes ought to be ſo ordered, we are taught; <hi>Reioyce in the Lord alwaies,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 4.</note> againe I ſay, <hi>reioyce,</hi> vnto this we ought very carefully to looke.</p>
               <p>For dayly inumerable things of ſmall moment there are, which popoſe a matter of ioy vnto vs, from all which a man muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently extricate and acquit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, nor doe I thinke it needefull here to vſe any example. For this is a generall rule, concerning eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ioy that is not in GOD, or actually referred to God. Yet that by more aduiſedly ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring whatſoeuer hath beene ſaid, hereof we may the more liuely feele it, we may obſerue, that if it be accounted an abiect and baſe thing for a great King flouriſhing in all abundance to eſteeme a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſcrappe of ſiluer ſo highly, that the gaine of it would greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce him, and the loſſe of it
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:14934:268"/>mightily afflict him and caſt him downe: then farre more is our baſeneſſe, who hauing euer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the infinit good things which God poſſeſſeth for himſelfe and vs in which we ought to reioyce, we yet reioyce in other things of no worth, offring themſelues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs: ſuch as are all the things of this world: chiefely ſeeing we ought to loue him more then our ſelues, and ſo eſteeme his glory more then our owne. 2.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> We may ſay the ſame of him that grieues for any thing that can befal him in world, which hee can looſe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be ſinne, or bring him to ſinne, as in like manner we may ſay, that it is great abiection to grieue for ſuch things, hauing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his eyes ſo great glory, for which he ought to reioyce.</p>
               <p>Therefore we muſt neuer ſuffer any griefe or heauineſſe to tarry in the ſoule, but that which ariſeth for our ſinnes. Grieue for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſaith a holy man, but for ſinne onely. And this is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:14934:269"/>for ſorrow is either for the euill that is preſent, or the good that is loſt: now ſeeing no true euill or good can be loſt, but for ſinne, we ſhould not be ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full full for any other thing.</p>
               <p>Beſides, we may adde that which wee haue ſpoken of ioy, that to whom ſo great an euill ſo falleth, whereat to grieue as is ſinne, hee deales very inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately in diuiding his powers to ſorrow for any other thing, ſeeing all his ſtrength and ability ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth not to ſorrow ſo much for his ſinnes as he ought. Therefore that wee may the better expell ſorrow from vs, we muſt conſider, and ſay, when all kinde of tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation lieth vpon vs, why haue I greater care of my ſelfe, then my God would that I ſhould haue, ſeeing I am not my owne, but his? Hee will haue care of that which is his owne; knowing what is expedient, what ſhould befall it. This is that which I would ſay; that whatſoeuer doth
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:14934:269"/>befall vs that is painefull, it ought to be acceptable and welcome to vs, how long ſoeuer it laſt, as that thing which is conuenient vnto him that is Gods, nor to grieue more for it, then God whoſe wee are, commaunds that wee ſhould grieue.</p>
               <p>If any aske, how much GOD would haue vs to grieue. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere: that he would haue vs to take ſo much griefe, as the acer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity of the thing that befalls vs, doth inforce vs to feele, yet ſo, as that wee reioyce ſo much at the ſorrow, as it ſhall laſt, as at the thing which comes from the hand of God, and that by this ioy wee may labour to driue away the griefe, as the caſe ſhall require, that we procure it after that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which we know that God would haue vs doe it, and becauſe hee would haue vs doe it: for by one meanes it behoues vs to bee deliuered from the ſtate of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, namely by procuring leui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, and by another way from
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:14934:270"/>the ſtrength of famine, namely by procuring meate: alſo after one faſhion from the violence of could, by getting fit garments: and after another from the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of perſecution, whileſt it hinders vs from the worſhip of God by reaſon of the debility of our nature; to which is neceſſary, that wee giue our ſelues wholy to vertues, thereby to gather ſtrengh: or elſe to flee the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, whileſt our powers doe no more ſuffice to beare it, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with that, that God hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired vs thereunto. Yet are all theſe remedies together with all others, which are alſo neceſſary, to be procured with ioyfull mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration: and becauſe GOD would that wee ſhould procure them, wherby being deliuered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch greeuances, wee might with more quiet ſerue God; albeit there is a neceſſity of ſuffering them, ſo long as we cannot ſhake them off: and that we ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce for them, becauſe GOD
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:14934:270"/>would haue vs to beare them, for many cauſes, ſome manifeſt, but others hid from vs.</p>
               <p>And truely I know not, how it commeth to paſſe, that euen in this life, God doth not giue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe wholy to that man, whom hee hath ſo wholy taken for his owne. But ſeeing it is certaine, that he wil giue himſelf wholy to him, happy ſhall that life be, for ſeeing God ſhall ſo be his, hee ſhall euer reioyce in his ſo great good and glory, as if they were his owne proper riches. Oh how bleſſed is that man, that knowes this Iubile, for there are no words which can manifeſt the ioy hee finds in his heart, whoſe ſoule, with the whole heart, ſhall thus ſay; Oh what an infinit good doe I poſſeſſe, ſeeing God which is more I, or more mine, then I am my owne, doth poſſeſſe ſo infinit good things, whom I now ſee, albeit imperfectly, yet I ſeeke him and hold him for my owne, more then euer I held or
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:14934:271"/>poſſeſſed any thing for mine. Let vs not thinke that this can bee expreſſed in words, but let vs (to our purpoſe) conclude on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that ſo great a good ought to mooue vs, that wee ſhould not otherwiſe feele our griefes, but as wee now haue ſpoken, ſeeing wee ought not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire for our ſelues any other thing, then the diuine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe hath ordeined for vs, and after that manner he ſhall thinke fit to diſpoſe.</p>
               <p>But it is fit that we diligently ponder all the words wee now ſpeake, becauſe they are of great vſe, and conteine great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Therefore euery ſeruant of God muſt be prouident, that by the ſaid co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiderations he preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put from him the infinit paines and ſorrowes, which the miſeries and diſc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tments of the world thruſt vpon him. To which thing are neceſſary the acts ſpoken of in the ſixth Inſtruction preſently caſting away the vnwillingneſſe
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:14934:271"/>(as it is there ſpoken) and that ſo often as ſuch griefe ſhall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre: or to ſpeake more rightly, euery one ſhould in will occurre and meete the ſorrowes, that hee may deſire thoſe things from whence ſorrowes and afflictions ariſe. For when theſe are deſired, then the ſorrow ceaſeth, which firſt did ariſe from heauen euen that we hated theſe things, and it is moſt iuſt that wee ſhould deſire thoſe things, from whence commeth ſuch grieuances, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well for that they come from the hand of God,<note place="margin">Iob. 1.</note> as alſo for that our ſinnes haue deſerued them, and with all many good things doe come vnto vs by them.</p>
               <p>Therefore from hence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, as from a certain rule, that the faithfull ſeruant of God ought either ſo to expell, or elſe to direct his ioy and griefe to Godwards, that nothing elſe ſhould occupy his thoughts beſides God, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by perfectly to expel it, he may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour to make it a cuſtome,
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:14934:272"/>to take vp ſome painefull thing: and as often as any delightfull thing or ioye ſhall fall out, to bring fourth the act of ſorrow and griefe: and againe on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, to reioyce as often, as any grieuous thing ſhall fall out.</p>
               <p>And ſurely it is moſt iuſt, that he who offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding God and expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him from the ſoule, hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered his ſoule to Satan, ſhould ioy at euery griefe and grieue at euery ioy that befalls him. In this manner is that to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood which is wont to bee ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: Let thy ioy bee euer vnto thee for a puniſhment, and thy puniſhment for a loy. And hee onely ſhall performe this, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, who ſhall more manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know, that all things in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and in reſpect of vs are nothing, but ſo farre fourth as they are of themſelues or by vs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to Godward.</p>
               <p>And albeit euery man thinkes he knowes this: yet happy is that
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:14934:272"/>man in the world, that ſall true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know and feele this in truth. 3. Now as for the affection of hope,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> we muſt know that it is not the ſame with that vertue which is called Hope. For that which is the vertue, is not common to all men: but that which is the affection of the minde, all men haue: ſo that it is naturall, as well to Heathens as Chriſtians, in ſo much, that as we ſee it is naturall as well to the one as the other to reioyce and to feare, ſo ſhall wee ſee the Heathen hope for diuerſe things as well as the Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>Of this hope which is no ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, but an affection common to all, wee may obſerue, that albeit wee are inclined to Hope for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things often, yet nothing ought to reft in our hearts to bee hoped for beſides God, and thoſe things by which we thinke wee may the better draw neere to God, to ſerue him: for whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer thing elſe we muſt thinke to be of no worth: an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> if at any time,
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:14934:273"/>we ſee the hope of any thing to fix it ſelfe more in our hearts, then felicity and vertues, we muſt preſently expell it, ſeeing that it is euidently againſt the due and right end.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. So muſt wee alſo doe in feare, namely, caſt oft all that which is not concerning God. The reaſon whereof the Prophet ſhewes: <hi>The Lord it my light and my ſaluation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal 26.</note> 
                  <hi>whom then ſhall I feare?</hi> and ſo the Sonne of God: feare not them that can kill the body, but feare him that can caſt body and ſoule into hell fire. <hi>q. d.</hi> You are much to feate the offending of God, or to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke him to anger: but he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be more prouoked to anger, then if by your ſinnes, you giue him occaſion to ſend body and ſoule into hell fire. Hence it is that hee cries, <hi>Alas I will reuenge my ſelfe of my enemies.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſ. 1.</note> Therefore moſt iuſt it is, that this great God be ſo feared with a filiall feare: For it is more to be deſired, that we ſhould pluck out our eyes, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="457" facs="tcp:14934:273"/>to doe any thing to diſpleaſe ſo great a God and ſo good a Father and Lord as he is.</p>
               <p>Nay hee is not to be feared with any other kinde of feare, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he only can giue both life and death eternall: and fearing him, there is no cauſe thou ſhouldeſt feare any thing elſe in the world. <hi>Qui timet Deum omnia timent eum, qui non timet, Deu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, timet omnia:</hi> He that feares God all things feare him: but he that feares not God, feares all things. For albeit all the calamities of the world ruſh in vpon vs, if we feare them not, they can affect vs with no euill, which can truely be called euill. But rather if we boldly confront them, and take them with a thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full minde, in that our God and Redeemer, would haue vs to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace them, in memory of thoſe things which hee ſuffred for vs, they will increaſe in vs perpetuall dignity and glory. Therefore being prepared hereunto, that we eſteeme of no worth, or rather
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:14934:274"/>eſteeme as a pretious ornament, whatſoeuer calamity can befall vs in the world, if any feare creepe vpon vs, by and by in will, wee meet it, to repell it, that it haue not that place in vs. In which the reuerent feare of God, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for vs, ought to be placed, to this, the ſixth Inſtruction is neceſſary.

All theſe 11. paſſions are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed about ſuch things as are perceiued by the outward ſenſes: and doe proſecute thoſe three moſt pleaſant good things in the world,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> by name, <hi>Honeſt, Profitable, Delectable</hi> good:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and doe abhorre the contrarie euils:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> but Honeſt here, is not taken for that which is graceful, proceeding from true vertues, but for eſtimation and honour of the world.</p>
                  <p>And this is the nature of the Concupiſcible, to weigh and pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe three good things and and their contraries according to their proper natures, and ſo ſtands either well or ill affected. But becauſe, it is often vnable to enioy the good things by reaſon of the many difficulties, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they are beſieged; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the worke of nature, that the Iraſcible ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent which might ouercome the difficulties of obſtacles and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derances, and place the concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcible in quiet poſſeſsion of the
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:14934:280"/>good.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1 It is the generall conſent as well of Philoſophers as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines, that the concupiſcible is before the Iraſcible, and therefore the paſſions thereof in the firſt place to bee ſtirred vp, and that the ſame are the beginning and end of paſſions of the Iraſcible. And the reaſon is good: for no man hopes or deſpaires (which are paſſions of the Iraſcible) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it bee for that which before he loued and deſired, (which are
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:14934:282"/>the paſſions of the Concupiſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) nor by the Iraſcible dare hee attempt againſt that is euill or feare euill, except by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcible hee firſt hated it: and hee cannot hate any thing but that which diffents from the good firſt loued.</p>
                  <p>From this it commeth to paſſe, that not onely the Concupiſcible is before the Iraſcible, but alſo that all paſſions take their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and riſe from loue, the firſt paſſion of the Concupiſcible, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which all the reſt are faſt tied. For no man deſireth, or is deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſaue with that which hee lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth; or hateth, fleeth, or is ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull, but for euill which is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the good which hee loueth: or hopeth or deſpaireth, but for that good which hee lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth; or feares, or dares, or is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, but for the euill which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the good he loueth.</p>
                  <p>Therefore wee may thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe loue; that it is the firſt motion, which good brings vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:14934:282"/>the appetite, or more plainely; the firſt impreſſion whereby the appetite out of the knowledge of ſome good, is affected, whileſt the good thing it knoweth, doth pleaſe it. This ſimilitude from nature will illuſtrate the thing well: fos as euery thing which doth ingender confers firſt forme to the things ingendred and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards a motion agreeable to that forme; as when the fire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flames the ayer, it firſt imprints in it the fiery forme, and then a fiery motion to tend vpwards; ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery good doth not only imprint a certain form in the ſence, which conceiueth the image of good, but alſo in the appetite, the image of the ſence mediating it ſelfe; that is to ſay loue, which is as the forme of the loued, and by loue ſtirs vp the motion of deſire, whereby the appetite returnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to the good it ſelfe, the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle being ended.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is euident, what is concupiſence (which when it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companieth
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:14934:283"/>reaſon, is called de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire) for it is a certaine extenſion or progreſſion of loue, or rather: that motion or ſteppe whereby the appetite affected with good, beginnes to incline to that good it ſelfe. For after that good (which is the motion of loue) hath pleaſed the appetite, the appetite inlarged it ſelfe to receiue that good (which is the motion of concupiſcence or deſire) by which motion it is ſaid to be drawne of the good it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>It is violently caried, becauſe drawne by pleaſure: Therefore the deſire is wont to wax ſtrong, if it bee not graunted to enioy pleaſure euen vntill a certaine ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, which is called feruour, and is the effect of loue, the which thing Lauguor (being another effect of loue) is wont to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, which is a moſt grieuous ſadneſſe, of ſuch fury, it is often wont to kill men: but if the good deſired fall out as we would haue it, then followes delectation
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:14934:283"/>(which if it bee with the worke of reaſon is called ioy) and it is a motion of the ſoule placed in the good that pleaſeth it; or more clearely, that motion whereby the appetite perceiueth the good which it deſireth, in whoſe enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or poſſeſſion the appetite is placed, is called delectation or fruition, which is all one.</p>
                  <p>This paſsion is one of the chiefeſt and ſeemeth to bee the moſt effectuall of them all; for it fulfils the motion of loue: and in it loue ſeemeth to exerciſe all his powers: for ſeeing there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny effects of loue; as (beſides feruour and languor before na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) extaſie, liquefaction, vnion, mutuall inhaeſion, penetration, zeale, in imbracing of the preſent good almoſt all of them do waxe ſtrong and multiply.</p>
                  <p>Extaſie which ſignifieth the going out of the appetite from it ſelfe, that it may exiſt in that is good which it affects; whileſt good is preſent, acquireth ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth.
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:14934:284"/>Liquefaction which is a certaine emollition, rarefaction or, ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the heart, that as it were, the poores being opened, good may eaſily and quickly enter, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that it doe keepe his ſtrength good being abſent, yet is it filled with the drinking in of that which is good. Vnion, which is as it were a cotouching of louers Mutuall inhaeſion, which is the binding together of things that touch one another. Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, which is a certaine ſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding into the inwards of the heart, doe not fall out, but when good is preſent. Zeale, which is nothing elſe but the impatience of a conceit if any would inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, the inioyer would fight and contend moſt fiercely.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it is plaine that the paſsion of delight is compaſſed with many circumſtances, which doe eaſily demonſtrate his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. But euen the thing it ſelfe is ſo prooued, by experience, that without any other witneſſes, if
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:14934:284"/>any be asked, what is the thing moſt attractiue, whoſoeuer hee be, hee will anſwere: <hi>Trahit ſua quemque voluptas,</hi> euery mans plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is his adamant.</p>
                  <p>For as yet thoſe other two kindes of good, ſo: honeſt and pofitable good if wee take away pleaſure, would not draw any mans heart after them; which is a thing moſt worthy to bee knowne, and is conuinced by this reaſon: For wee ſhall ſee many borne in the country, whom if the King would draw into the City and inrich them with honours and commodities, they would vpon no other ground refuſe, then for that they would not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe the countrey pleaſures, to which they arc accuſtomed, and which they deſpaire to find elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. Seeing then that mans heart is ſicke with the loue and deſire of pleaſure, as of a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous feuer, let vs ſeeke for ſome remedie for theſe three paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>

That a fit remedy may bee prepared to the nature and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the diſeaſed, we muſt prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to the things that are to be ſpoken of the cure of paſsions, that mans heart moſt greedy of good things preſent, can neuer be pulled from, the loue of them, but by exchange of better good things: for it cannot bee, that honourable, profitable and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable things ſhould not pleaſe the appetite, ſeeing it cannot put off his natiue and inbred pronity and readineſſe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine them. Therefore that manner of curing is of all other moſt prudent which, better good things being propoſed, (whereof the appetite is capable) doth attempt to draw the heart of man from affection of preſent things to the loue of eternall things. For if wee will ſearch out the worke of GODS wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in the creation of man, wee
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:14934:285"/>ſhall finde, that our moſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull LORD God would not take away food and nutriment from theſe eleauen paſsions, but transferre it vnto better good things, that the ſence, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the ſuperiour part of man. Firſt his reaſon might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct both the appetite and alſo, the fleſh it ſelfe, according to their capacity, to thirſt after God, and to lift vp themſelues towards God.</p>
                  <p>For that thing which paſsions wrought in <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall, euen vnto that do the ſeruants of God and deſpiſers of the world aſpire: and oft times, as much as the diuine grace vouchſafeth to graunt in this corruption of our natures, are they made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of their deſires: amongſt whom, he was one, who ſaid; my heart and my fleſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in the liuing GOd; and in another place, my Soule thirſteth after thee, yea my fleſh how often? according to this
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:14934:286"/>doctrine therefore of weaning our paſsions from the forbidden good things, wee will giue theſe examples.</p>
                  <p>Let the examples bee thus: thou happily ſeeſt ſome thing which doth greatly pleaſe the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite with a ſudden motion: which is the motion of loue, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently thy heart extends it ſelfe to that thing which is the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Concupiſcence, for it coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that thing: if this thing bee graunted then ſucceeds a certaine delight of perceiuing of ioye touching the thing which ſeemes to agree to the appetite drawne on by the loue &amp; Concupiſcence aforeſaid, which is the motion of delight: and in this manner, doth that thing beare rule in his heart, that was ſo taken with the loue of it, and with a certaine kinde of fruition, hee delights in it, which is the end of delectation, and to conclude doth complete the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of loue. He therefore that is ſo tempted, let him firſt diſcerne
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:14934:286"/>the fault from the temptation: for in ſuch ſudden motions of loue and concupiſcence, often their followes no fault, becauſe in men of riper yeares, they preuent the conſent of reaſon: but if any ſinne lie hid, by the negligence of reaſon, it is a very ſmall one, which I would haue to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in all kindes of temptations: that I need not repeate the ſame thing againe.</p>

And thus may wee doe in all kinde of things, bee they honourable, profitable or delectable. The firſt of theſe

<pb n="478" facs="tcp:14934:288"/>and with greater delight &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment.</p>
                  <p>And the manner of doing it is this: hee muſt bee very circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, in the exerciſe of euery thing, that he ſet not his heart vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the apparant ſhew of things; but aſſoone as hee ſeeth any thing that is pleaſant, to turne away his heart, &amp; make haſt to breathe after heauenly things. For it is altogether impoſsible, that the other paſsions ſhould wax heauy or hurt vs, if the rootes of loue be cut vp.</p>
                  <p>Let this bee the example: a man ſees ſome profitable good thing, and forthwith aſſoone as he ſees it, whileſt his loue is ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp, he lifts vp his heart to heauen, ſaying, Oh how much more profitable things are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided for me there? He ſees ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that delights him, and whilſt his appetite growes in loue of it, his heart is inſtantly lift vp to heauen, ſaying, how much ſweeter ſhall my banquet be in
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:14934:288"/>heauen, where my meate ſhall be <hi>Manna</hi> Angels food, and my drinke the fountaine of life? Hee ſees ſome honourable good thing, namely, other mens eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation conceiued of his wittie learning, dexterity &amp;c. And whilſt the appetite beginnes to be carried to the loue of honour, he runnes, and lifts vp his heart, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, how much greater eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and honour ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of me in that moſt ample Court of heauen, then if I had the honour of the whole world?</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1 The definition of Hate. As good ſo ſoone as it is ſeene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genders the loue of it; ſo euill, by and by as it acknowledged, begets the hatred of it. Now hate is a certaine motion of the concupiſcible, diſſonant from
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:14934:289"/>euill: or more cleerely; it is the motion of auerſion, wherewith the appetite is affected, when any thing diſſonant or contrary and repugnant to it is repreſented: for as betwixt the appetite and good there is conſent; ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the appetite and euill there is diſſent.</p>
                  <p>Hence comes flight and abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the euill which is the motion of retraction, whereby the appetite departs from euill; as if we ſaid; that, that receſsion or declining whereby the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite retracts it ſelfe from euill which diſpleaſeth it, were ſlight or abhomination of the euill which is the intention of flight: for after that euill is by the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination repreſented, the appetite doth not onely diſagree and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come diſſonant (which is hatred) but alſo goes backe, which is ſlight.</p>
                  <p>Sadneſſe or ſorrow ſucceeds, when the euill is preſent; ſorrow comes from euill ioyned vnto the
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:14934:289"/>body with the apprehension of ſence: but ſadneſſe is for the euils conceiued by inward apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which may alſo therefore be paſt and to come which arc in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly conceiued, ſeeing ſorrow onely for the preſent time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues, whileſt the body is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. Therefore ſadneſſe or ſorrow is a certaine motion, whereby the appetite is vexed by the preſent euill; as if I ſaid, that it is the motion whereby the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite is oppreſſed with the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of a preſent euill. Theſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are of contrarie motion to thoſe we handled in the 9. Chap. for hate is auerſion from euill: loue the conuerſion to good: flight, is the departing from euill; deſire is the progreſſe to good; ſadneſſe is the oppreſſion of euill; delectation is the expanſion to good.</p>
                  <p>But as loue with the two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſsions is carried towards the honeſt, profitable and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable good: ſo hate with the 2.
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:14934:290"/>paſſions ariſing from it, inclines to the 3. fold euill, vnhoneſt, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, vnpleaſant. Now by good and euill, wee vnderſtand either the true or the apparant good: for whatſoeuer pleaſeth the appetite is good, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer is repugnant in this kinde is euill. But amongſt all other things in this place this is moſt attentiuely to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; that ſadneſſe one of the principall paſsions (which as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light complets the motion of loue, ſo it of hate) is a capitall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to true vertue: for beſides the hurt it brings to the body, this amongſt all paſsions is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt (for it hath the motion of contraction, contrary to the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall motion comming from the heart dilated) it moſt grieuouſly hurts the minde, as by this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon appears. For the minde is kept downe by the weight of the euill preſent; the actions are made more ſeeble: a certaine cold vapour and ſluggiſhneſſe
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:14934:290"/>runnes thorow the whole man, and almoſt diſſolues the ioints: whereby it is hardly mooued or elſe altogether ſlacks to the workes of vertue, which being difficult, ſtand need of exte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſion to vndertake difficult things, which by this reaſon is euident.</p>
                  <p>It is a thing well tried, that any ſorrow of the body long raging, in ſhort time the whole man muſt needes be diſſolued: nor can the imagination diuerte from thence to any other worke for ſorrow is the bond of the minde. Now if ſadneſſe be properly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as differing from ſorrow, it much needes worſe torment the minde then ſorrow: for the anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the minde are much more grieuous then thoſe of the body; which is thus from the contrary prooued: it is the generall opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on both of Diuines and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, that the delectations of the Spirit are greater then thoſe of the body: for ſeeing delectation is a motion proceeding from the
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:14934:291"/>coniunction of good, by how much as the good is greater, the coniunction ſtraighter, &amp; the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite more inacted to perceiue pleaſure, ſo much the greater ſhall the delectation be, but the goods of the minde are greater then of the body, as being Spirituall; more narrowly ioyned, as being without any body betwixt; more liuely perceiued, as hauing the vnderſtanding to penetrate the eſſence of good.</p>
                  <p>Therefore by the ſame reaſons, the euills of the minde inwardly apprehended arc greater: becauſe they belong to the minde, their coniunction is greater: for euill inwardly conceiued is moſt nere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conioyned and repugnes the appetite; but outwardly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, doth neerely repugne the body, (but if it ſhould onely hurt the body, the appetite not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting, it ſhould bee more light, yea and ſometimes it ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, for many with delight of the appetite, euen for foule cauſes,
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:14934:291"/>doe ſuffer hunger, blowes and ſtripes.) To conclude euill is; more intenſly perceiued, but the inward ſence is more able. Hence may we collect how diligently wee ought to cut off the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of ſadneſſe, and of what weight it is prudently to cure theſe diſeaſes. For the learned know that theſe paſsions, but eſpecially the third do often put the vnexperienced worſhippers of Chriſt out of the way of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: that not without cauſe the Apoſtle was inſtant; reioyce in the Lord, euermore, againe I ſay re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce: for it behooued him to ſpeake it againe becauſe it was of infinit weight.</p>

<pb n="486" facs="tcp:14934:292"/>ſwift motion, as much as belongs to it, the appetite flees from it (which is ſlight) and being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded or conſtreined to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it, he is caſt downe with the burden of heauineſſe and griefe. Then therefore hee that hath care of himſelfe, aſſoone as the motion of hate ariſeth, may thus commaund himſelfe, abſteine from thy auerſion: for it is not worthy of hate, if I will heare reaſon ſpeake: for many more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodious things muſt wee ſuffer, for the loue of vertues and expediting of the minde from the fetters of the body: for the liberty of man is by theſe moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons hurt, whileſt hee hates the things which are not truely euill; and will make him languiſh from the ſtudy of reaſon. This manner of commanding the paſsion (as I ſaid of loue) is common to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then men. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. There is another very Chriſtian manner which is to propoſe to the appetite true euills, which by the inſtruction
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:14934:292"/>of faith it may abhorre, and this comes from the ſuperiour part of man: thus, abſtaine from hate: for here is nothing worthy of hate, ſeeing ſinne is a wanting, which only is worthy of deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for that as concerning the incommodity, if it be without fault certainely it pleaſeth God well. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. But there is a thing more diuine than this; and that is taken from the imitation of Chriſt; thus: abſteine from hate: for how much more incommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous was the croſſe of Chriſt on which for thy ſake he ſuffred wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly? is this the imitation of Chriſt Ieſus crucified? who when the foxes had holes &amp; the fowles of heauen neſts, yet had not where to hide his head and yet was moſt worthy of eternall reſt?</p>
                  <p>By ſuch exhortations is the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour part wont ſo to preuaile, that by his command and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all motions, the appetite is wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened: nay ſometimes by a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den conuerſion it begins to loue,
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:14934:293"/>what before it hated. But oft-times theſe kinds of repreſſing the paſſions doe not profit, becauſe the appetite cannot receiue theſe reaſons, of the honeſt good; or elſe it will not bee inſtructed by reaſon, in reſpect of the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and heate of the paſſion; and then it will be to purpoſe, to repreſent to it other more grieuous euills, which by the experiment of leſſer euills, it hath cauſe to feare; to ſhunne which euills, if not willingly, yet pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, he will not hate the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent euill which he beganne to deteſt, and this may thus be done; deſiſt from hatred: nay loue and imbrace this incommodity: for art not thou mercifully dealt withall, who haſt deſerued the torments of hell? ought not the fiery flames of hell to be changed for this incommodity?</p>
                  <p>Theſe and ſuch like preſent remedies are to be ſought out, before ſadneſſe and griefe haue taken too deepe rootes: for if the
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:14934:293"/>griefe doe grow not from a light cauſe, but proceed from ſome grieuous cauſes of the ſoule, ſuch as are woont to befall to men of a ſcrupulous conſcience, or vehemently vexed for the ſins of their life paſt; there are ſome more effectuall remedies to bee ſought out. For the written coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailes and (as it were) dead letters haue not ſo much power to heale theſe diſeaſes which creepe into mans inwards, and doe extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the powers both of body and ſoule, putting on diuers formes, as the Oracles of a liuing voice, of ſome ſweete ſinger in <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell,</hi> who according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the euill, can mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter a word to the wearied in due ſeaſon.

                  <p>To conclude, we may obſerue that theſe three paſsions may not only be encountred with the ſaid reaſons, whereby the ſuperiour part maybe able to keepe them downe, but alſo the true louers of Chriſt both may and ought often to ſtirre them vp (as in the next Chapter appeares) that as loue, deſire, delectation are ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp tor proſecute the goods of the minde; ſo hate, flight, and griefe muſt be rowſed vp to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt the euills of the ſoule; which may thus bee done, the ſuperiour part inſtructing the inferiour.</p>
                  <p>The ſuperiour part doth finde the appetite to be deterred from labours, contempt, and auſterity of life; and doth thus vrge it: if thou wilt hate, doe not hate thoſe things which are not fowle, but

But yet if for all this, it doe not ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borre the turpitude of ſinne, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it doth not ſo cleerely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it: let it hate, flee, and grieue for the puniſhments of hell and terrour of that great iudgement: which the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can more eaſily repreſent.

                  <p>But amongſt the fiue paſſions of the Iraſcible, Hope holds the firſt place: which is nothing elſe but a motion towards the difficult good which it beleeues may be obtained: or to ſay more cleerely, it is a motion, wherby the appetite is ſtirred vp to acquire that good which is hardly acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which the concupiſcible lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, and which is thought may be obtained.</p>
                  <p>Boldneſſe and Audacity ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds this Hope, which Audacity we call a motion of the appetite proſecuting an imminent difficult thing: as if I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Touching theſe two paſſions, we muſt obſerue, that thoſe who are giuen to loue, are more inab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led both to Hope, and to dare then others; for ſeeing both the paſsions are motions of progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and heate which is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of loue, by his dilatation; and opening conferres much to the motion of progeſsion: it commeth to paſſe, that Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers are more prompt and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to hope and to dare: eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſuch as ſtand well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to Heauenly things, for the Conſcience of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, inioyning the diuine aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance begets a certaine ſecurity: which doth chiefly conduce both to Hope and Audacity.

<pb n="495" facs="tcp:14934:296"/>ſeemes a difficult thing vnto him to obtaine it: for it behoues him, to excogitate ſome meanes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile his minde vnto him, and ſo fit himſelfe to auoide his checks and frownes: which would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire both time, and diſcourſe, and ſome other duties, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out labour; yet it ſeemeth poſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; Therefore albeit all other duties be neglected, hee deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines to deale ſeriouſly in this thing; hee is rayſed by hope, and goes forewards with bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: but theſe paſsions he may check thus.</p>

                  <p>Therefore deſperation is a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the appetite, from good which it beleeueth, cannot bee acquired; as if we ſhould ſay, that it is a motion whereby the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite is oppreſſed or caſt downe, when one thinkes he cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the good that hee loueth.
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:14934:299"/>Hence ariſeth feare which is a motion of the appetite departing from euill to come, which it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reſiſt; as if wee ſhould ſay it were a motion, whereby the appetite is contracted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, when the difficult e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill is imminent, before it bee preſent: for it is not a ſimple departure, as Flight, or Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homination of euill, but a depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the appetite for the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of the euill at hand. But when the difficult euill hath the nature of iniurie, then it is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                  <p>Now anger is a motion of the appetite, to reuenge; or more clearely a motion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the appetite being hurt, wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth hote to repay the iniury: which doth reſpect the reuenge, as that which is good for it, and him from whence the iniury com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, as euill, whence it hath a mixt oblation.</p>

For deſperation is not onely for the euill of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing difficulty, but alſo, for the ſole exceſſe of good, which albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it it may ſeeme to fall vpon the ſame point and head of difficulty, yet it ſhewes the manifold moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of deſperation ariſing in the hearts of ſloathfull Chriſtians, ſometimes the difficulty and ſometimes the ſublimity of the thing being repreſented: from whence it is, that they thinke of no ioyes; without propoſing whereof vnto them, they ſcarce meanely profit.</p>
                  <p>But feare is wont ſo to charge Nature with floathfulneſſe, and ſo to manacle the whole man, yea with the verie feare of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent vertues, much more with the feare of imminent la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, that ſtupour and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that, is, the vnaccuſtomed

And to conclude, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more hurtfull then feare to the ſtudie of vertues, which are of generous hearts obteined.</p>
                  <p>But anger is a moſt fierce paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; which ſeeing it is ſtirred vp from deſpight and contempt onely or thoſe things which are reduced to contempt, hurts ſo much the worſe, by how much it is more conſonant to a worſe vice, <hi>i.</hi> Pride.

Then doth reaſon worke in this manner, namely the ſecond of thoſe three waies of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the paſſions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Lord is my light and my ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, whom ſhal I feare.

For when the inferiour part of Chriſt feared the acerbity of his paſſion, euen to the ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of bloud; hee ſtirred vp by deliberate act of reaſon, the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of audacity, that hee might conflict with feare and preuaile againſt it: and ſo riſing, hee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed his Diſciples: <hi>Ariſe, let vs goe hence, behold hee that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traieth me is at hand.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3 <hi>The remedy of the paſſion of anger.</hi> It often falleth out that a man either by words or geſtures, findes himſelfe to be little eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and contemned, of ſome ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his inferiour, or not much aboue him: by and by, anger is inflamed, and hee deſires &amp; ſeekes in the ſame manner to render at leaſt, a like kinde of reuenge: for the appetite will begin to complaine, ſaying; hee ought not to haue made ſo ſmall account of me; he might haue riſen vnto me; hee might haue put off his hat: he ſhould not ſo lightly haue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued the things I ſpake: Hee ought not ſo to haue contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, he ought not to haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouled mee in that manner: hee might haue anſwered mee more mildly, ſeeing I am no way infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to him; as many things will the loue of a mans owne excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency obiect.</p>
                  <p>But now, the ſuperiour part will herein doe thus, to mitigate this paſſion. Thou fierce diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:14934:303"/>paſſion be quieted. For it becomes not man endued with reaſon, like a beaſt, to waxe fierce and angry, and by a certaine drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe of fury to become mad, for the turpitude and vileneſſe of this paſſion, doth euen in the countenance bewray it ſelfe; whileſt the eyes doe ſparkle, the lips tremble, the ſpeech is hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and the whole man is alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from that meekeneſſe, which being a ſociable creature, is naturall to him. This manner albeit but naturall: yet is it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry effectuall to the ſubduing of anger.</p>
                  <p>But the ſecond kinde of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing the paſſions is more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the true Chriſtian; and that is thus: bleſſed are the meeke, for they ſhall poſſeſſe the Land of the liuing: and ſhall I for this beaſtly and brutiſh paſſion deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poile my ſelfe of the right of this inheritance, which faith ſhewes vnto me? The third kinde of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming this paſſion may bee this,
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:14934:304"/>and moſt apt for ſuch as will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Chriſt: <hi>For as a Lambe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſhearer, hee opened not his mouth; and as a ſheepe vnto the ſlaughter he was led:</hi> when hee was curſed, hee curſed not againe: when hee ſuffred, hee complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not, hee deliuered himſelfe into the hands of him, that iudged vniuſtly, and ſhall not I be meeke and milde?</p>
                  <p>Many other reaſons might be vſed to reſtraine theſe paſſions; but here I deſire may bee obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued (as alſo in other paſſions;) that theſe paſsions may profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably bee exerciſed, if they bee transferred to diuine things: and ſurely the vſe of deſperation, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, not ſo proper as of other paſſions (for it hath not any ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritiall good which for the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it, is to be deſpaired) may be this, according to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of the Kingly Prophet: truſt not in Princes, nor in the ſonnes of men in whom is no ſaluation: <hi>q. d.</hi> hope not, nay deſpaire of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:14934:304"/>from men, who altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are voide of it; for that ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation which the world by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent lie doth promiſe, is to bee deſpaired of.</p>
                  <p>Feare hath a moſt large field: for what is it that iuſtly can bee feared in this life, not ſudden death, nor the torments of hell; nor the ſeuerity of the laſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? nay nothing, albeit the moſt terrible euills of this life ought to put vs in feare: for Chriſt hath ſaid, feare not them, that can kill the body, but feare him, who hauing killed the body, is able to ſend the ſoule into hell fire.</p>
                  <p>In like manner, anger may bee exerciſed many waies: there are ſinnes; there arc enemies of the ſoule, and amongſt others moſt cruell, are the paſſions which doe continually diſturbe and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne the reaſon of man: but againſt theſe enemies, our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt hath taught vs, that anger may wholeſomely be ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:14934:305"/>vp in vs, whileſt being moſt meeke, yet did hee waxe hote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt deſilers and abuſers of the Temple. Thus haue wee briefely been taught to maſter our paſſions which are the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt enemies to the reparation of our ſoules.</p>
                  <p>But yet before wee conclude this point, let vs take this obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation with vs: to conſider dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, the originall increaſe, and declyning of our owne proper paſſions; for beſides the former things, we ſhal finde many things of much profit, if wee ſhall dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently marke, that ſometimes this paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; ſometimes that, as if they were borne of diuers parents, doe produce ſundry effects: as by the example following may appeare.</p>
                  <p>There is nothing, doubtleſſe, ſeemes leſſe conſonant to anger then delectation: and yet it often growes vp with anger, as when a man in his fury reuengeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but griefe and heauineſſe, doth more directly diſagree with
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:14934:305"/>delectation, then anger; and yet griefe, in the very motion of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row conceiued of the abſence of the thing is cauſe of delectation, whilſt it begets the memory of the thing beloued.</p>
                  <p>But the other are more plaine: that namely, out of the loue of good, the hatred of euill which is repugnant to it, ariſeth: &amp; out of concupiſcence and deſire of the good deferred, doth ſorrow grow, by reaſon of deferring it: and this duell of the 2. paſſions, thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting together, is very well knowne, ſeeing towards one and the ſame thing, as namely faſting, the appetite, both dares do it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hopes for victory, &amp; feares alſo, becauſe terrified with the difficulty: which do ſerue for this purpoſe, that both the various commixtions of paſſions may bee knowne, and alſo that their ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry remedies may ſucceed.</p>
                  <p>But this muſt euery man moſt carefully labour to know: namely, of what paſſion hee is moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:14934:306"/>infeſted; for loue vexeth ſome moſt, ſome hate, others feare, and others anger doth moſt trouble. And as the powers of the ſoule being intent vnto one acte the ſoule doth more remiſly worke in other acts: ſo whileſt the inferiour part doth exhale the fury by the motions of one paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, it is vſually mooued more faintly with other paſsions.</p>
                  <p>But after that a man ſhall once know his capitall enemy, he muſt then bethinke himſelfe of entring into a combate with him; and by the death of him to extinguiſh all his aſſaults. Of thoſe reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies for the maſtering of paſsions, whereof we haue treated, he may take which hee thinketh doth moſt forcibly worke with him; or in his owne diſcretion chuſe ſome other: to the vndergoing of which combate, if the paſsion be more fierce, we muſt labour to get the helpe of perſeuerance, which is a vertue, that ſweares perpetuall fealty to God, which
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:14934:306"/>can neuer ſuffer any declination, hauing the victory and garland promiſed by our Sauiour euer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the eyes of it, whereby to be ſtirred vp: which is no leſſe, then eternally to be ſaued.</p>
                  <p>Nor let the difficulties or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers euer deterre them from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuering in this combate with paſsions. For how many noble, learned and worthy of honour ſhall wee ſee, that for 20. 30. or more yeares doe liue in the Courts of Princes, and with ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and knocking waxe old ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: rand yet either fall ſhort of all hope, or elſe are but (as the beſt) tormented with their ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards? But how many ſuch men, who die before the Princes, in whom, they placed their hopes, and periſh eternally; who if they had contended to ſubdue their paſsions, and put themſelues into Gods ſeruice, might haue ſhined in Sanctity, and abounded with eternall riches? Therefore how much more eaſily, and profitably
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:14934:307"/>may we conteſt with our paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and by a compendious way come to the crowne of glory?</p>
                  <p>But beſides, doth the ſhipwrack of ſo many ſleets and the loſſe of ſo much gold, diſturne any of thoſe from ſayling to the <hi>Indies</hi> whom God hath deliuered from ſuch dangers? it is a wonder to ſee how boldly they contend with the waues &amp; ſtormes, with what ſweate and ſorrow, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly encounter: how after they haue beene twice or thrice deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the iawes of death, yet doe they neuer change their manner of life, but goe on with a reſolute courage. Surely theſe mens iniquity and folly, is the Chriſtians ſchoole: for if they bee twice or thrice deliuered from death, after ſo many nauiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, when being ſufficiently inriched, they thought to returne home and reſt themſelues, and yet are ſwallowed vp of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenging ſtorme: How much more honourable and ſafe is
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:14934:307"/>it, albeit neuer ſo many tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions aſſault vs, and auxieties vexe vs, to hold that courſe, which can neuer bring any ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack?</p>
                  <p>But generally this is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, from the externall acts (for we haue chiefely handled the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the internall acts, which are the originals of the externall) for the remedy of euery paſſion, that the externall act of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary paſſion may bee exerciſed, if the paſsion it ſelfe and the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances doe ſuffer it. For I do not thinke, that ſuch external acts are neceſſary to all paſsions, for that deſperation and hope, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by internall acts. But my meaning is, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> opportunity ſuffers, that then it is expedient to exerciſe the externalls acts, which may either ingender the contrary affect, or elſe extinguiſh the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; for wee doe not properly ſpeake of the contrary, becauſe anger hath no contrary paſſion, but yet may be extinguiſhed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="518" facs="tcp:14934:308"/>
Examples of this inſtruction, there are both many and vſuall: for if any be poſſeſſed with a chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh feare of dead folkes, if they often handle dead carcaſſes and bones, it will driue away that feare. If an angry man be often ſet vpon with opprobries and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches; he will by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle grow leſſe angry: for as it is commonly ſpoken, there is no paſsion ariſeth from things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed. If any man labour of ſloath which is a kinde of griefe, throw cold water on him violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or vſe ſome ſharper remedy, and he will ſhake off that drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe in ſhort time. If any bee delighted with neate and fine cloathes, cloathe him with courſe and ragged garments, and within few daies, hee will put of that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Theſe and ſuch like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall remedies for the ſubduing of paſsions may bee vſed, as eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man ſhall thinke fitteſt for himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>But now, if wee will ioyne to
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:14934:308"/>theſe externall and internall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, the practiſe and care of praier, the thing will ſucceed as wee would haue it. For this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe is the moſt effectuall of all other to the maſtering of our paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; the reaſon is moſt ſtrong: the very indeauour it ſelfe of lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp the heart vino diuine things by a certaine naturall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, doth weaken the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour part of man, and diſturnes it from its owne prouocations; which is made euident thus: for the paſsions are not ſtirred vp but by a fore-running knowledge of the ſences: therefore hee that hath his inward ſences intent and ſetled vpon the imagination of diuine things, ſhall cut off the rootes of paſsions, as it were with the ſworde of that knowledge. Therefore let vs often implore the diuine helpe, for amongſt all remedies that is chiefeſt.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, this muſt obſeruing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be noted, that theſe eleuen paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions if they be ſuffred licentiouſly

                  <p>Therfore, whether (as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) any man be tempted with any

For then the violence of the temptation moouing the inferiour part of man, if reaſon by any meanes neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect lect the paſsions ariſing in the ſenſitiue appetite, to bee carried vnto vile things, which although it come not to a full deliberation, yet it is a ſinne.</p>

By this is euident, that it is generally true, that from one expreſſe or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit conſent of reaſon and will all ſinnes, but chiefly great ſinnes do ariſe.</p>
                  <p>But let euery man doe his dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, to know a temptation from conſent, &amp; accuſtome them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to reſiſt the firſt aſſaults va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly: as long as the knowledge of temptations &amp; the wil to reſiſt is of force with vs, we can neuer (ſuch is the goodneſſe of God) fall vnwittingly into any grieuous ſinnes.</p>

                  <p>It is a happy euent of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which the Sonne of God who in all things was tempted yet without ſinne, hath left vnto vs, moſt ſweetely comforting his troupes, and ſaying, <hi>You are they, that haue taried with me in my temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: and I giue vnto you a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome as my Father gaue vnto mee a Kingdome, that you ſhould cate and drinke at my table.</hi> And what is a wanting to them that ſhall feaſt at that table, that they may not valiantly goe together to it?

<pb n="530" facs="tcp:14934:315"/>and exerciſes for the reparation of the ſlaughter which ſinne hath made in the ſoule, is the loue of God, which being the fire which God would haue euer burning vpon the Altar of our hearts; all that we haue yet ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the reparation of the ſoule, is onely directed vnto it. And if any will know of what dignity this loue of God is, hee ſhall ſee that whatſoeuer hath beene ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the reparation and clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the ſoule, is but little to the acting of ſo worthy and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime an enterpriſe. For of ſo great excellency is the loue of God, that none of thoſe bleſſed Spirits, nor any other created thing or which can be created, is able to doe a more ſoueraigne worke. For which cauſe the Son of God calls this the great &amp; firſt commandement: Nay, ſay that all the labours and powers of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Men together, were in any one Angell or Man, yet were they not all able to doe a worke

                  <p n="1">1 This loue of God being ſo glorious and ioy ous a thing when it is expreſſed in words, what ioy I and glory ſhall it bee to ſeele it and how much more to doe it? This is the holy worke of God: I ſay the holy and whole worke and labour of God: for whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer God worketh withall his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:14934:316"/>powers, is onely to loue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſo much as his Maieſty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth and is worthy, that is; infinitly. For out of his owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit goodneſſe and excellency he is infinitly to be beloued: nor is there any excellency in heauen or earth, which is not much more his, then it is his that poſſeſſeth it: and from them all hee hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit glory, and loues it and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyceth and glorieth in it, and would alſo, that wee ſhould loue, it, thinke vpon it, and reioyce in it; ſeeing nothing is ſo conſonant to equity, as that with all our powers we ſhould loue him, from the louing of whom we muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ceaſe, albeit wee had infinit powers ſo to doe.</p>
                  <p>Therefore are we to giue God thankes, that in louing himſelfe infinitly, he ſupplies by his owne powers, what is defectiue in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of vs. Let vs euer reioyce in louing him who is ſo great dignity, that neuer ceaſing to glory at his excellencies, yet that
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:14934:316"/>which we doe is nothing if it bee compared to that hee deſerueth. For of ſo great glory and Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty is God, that he ſtands in no need of our ſeruice: but onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it, becauſe it is profitable of vs. This onely hee deſireth that we loue him and reloyce at his good things, for this is his owne holy worke. Therefore he would haue all men with all their ſtrength to doe that, which hee doth with all his ſtrength. And for that which remaines, he ſtands no neede it, no nor of this neither, but that it is good and iuſt and vnto? vs glorious: and therefore hee ſo much deſireth it, that hee laide downe his life for it, that ſo by dying he might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke vs to loue him: Beſides, that there are other things found in the Scriptures, which are by him commanded to bee deſired, that is for this end, becauſe they are helps to this loue, and to omit them would bee a great hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance to it. For neither are the
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:14934:317"/>vices which are prohibited any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, then the inordinate loue of vaine things, which doe occupie that place which is dipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted onely to the loue of GOD. Not doe vertuaes ſerue to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purpoſe, but to deſpoſe the ſoule to this loue; yet are they ſo neceſſary therunto, that it were great preſumption to thinke to obtaine it, without the mighty exerciſe of ſuch vertues.</p>
                  <p>That therefore wee may fitly ſpeake of this pretious loue, wee will firſt declare the various man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of louers, but withall iudging that beſt which is moſt ſublime and high. To which purpoſe wee may vſe this example. Therefore touching the variety of louers, we muſt obſerue that which by the experience of many, was a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony vnto them, when they had attained a greater knowledge of truth, namely, that they had a long time loued God as a moſt ſweete Lord, who had communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated himſelfe to them as a libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:14934:317"/>benefactor, in whoſe ſeruice, they were delighted, and often had asked of him many benefits, with great delectation in the contemptation of his bounty, and of the knowledge of his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent graces which they asked of him: and that often they came vnto him as to the fountaine in which they found ſo great ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as that they thought there was nothing a wanting to their loue of God. For they thought that the greatneſſe of that ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which they felt in the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitiue appetite, was nothing elſe but the greatneſſe of that loue. And would to GOD that all men who doe not loue God, did ſo loue him.</p>
                  <p>Yet God forbid, that thoſe who loue God ſhould bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with this loue, although it be very good, and ſo good as that it ſufficeth thus far, that for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine daies, beginners doe exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe themſelues therein; for they may ſo, eaſily come to that more
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:14934:318"/>excellent manner of louing God, which followeth. It an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that this loue I haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of is fraile, ſeeing that hee who ſo loueth, aſſoone as that ſweetneſſe is a wanting or gone, goes on with an abiect minde in the things of God, and is ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome of the frailties of his minde as if he neuer had had any ſuch loue. For hee doth ſo much procure vnto himſelfe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall delights, as to feede on delicate viands, to drinke the moſt pleaſant licours, to weare moſt gorgeous clothes, and ſuch other vanities, pleaſing to his appetite, ſenſuall friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, honours, fauours, euen as he doth that hath neuer begun to taſte the things that are of God.</p>
                  <p>Nay oft times, at ſuch time, as hee is viſited with ſuch an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of ſweetneſſe, hee is taken vp with many vaine affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and very ſenſuall, being drawne thereunto by the beauty and pleaſures of ſome perſons.
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:14934:318"/>Againe hee deſires to be ſeene, and to be accounted deuoute, and grieues if hee bee not repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for ſuch; nor doth hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce when he vnderſtands that others are accounted more feruent in deuotion, and ſuch other blemiſhes hee caſts vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelfe: all which are ſo abiect, that they ſuffer not the ſociety of that excellent loue of God (of which anone) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it haue not that ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Therefore wee may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that ſuch loue is but fraile, ſeeing it is the loue of him that loues for his owne bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and comfort. Yet let vs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the excellences of this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitiue loue.</p>
                  <p>For albeit ſuch loue is fraile, yet is it profitable for 2. things. Firſt, he that hath it may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly caſt from him the ſaid ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes, and loue of vaine things. Secondly, ſuch a one ſhall be in a verie neere diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to bring fourth many acts of

                     </gap> loue, when hee ſhall come to the knowledge of it.</p>
                  <p>There is therefore a more high and heauenly loue then that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, vnto which many had vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly attained, if they had knowne it: and the more of this loue that the ſoule acquires, of the greater perfection ſhall it be. This loue we will deſcribe with words rather declaring what we ought to doe to obtaine it, and being had to keepe it, then ſuch as for a ſmall time may worke ſome liking of it. Not for that I would expreſſe this loue in groſſe termes, but for that he who can attaine that loue which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in plaine words is to bee lifted vp of that ſweete louer, to the height of that loue, which mans power cannot expreſſe. Therefore now wee will deliuer ſome parcels of this loue.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 What it is: wee ſay it is a certaine worke or acte which the will produceth, ſtrongly and

And againe, that whatſoeuer thing is or can be, may loue him, ſerue and glorifie him, for his one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infinit goodneſſe and worth: and ſo farre as the excellency of his Maieſty requires, that withall our powers wee ſhould doe it. Theſe are profound words, and ſuch as daily hee muſt meditate which truely loues: that he may recogitate what God is, and may reioyce in it; againe that he may recogitate and bethinke himſelfe how great glory he hath, hauing an vniuerſall dominion ouer al vs, all other things, and to ioy hereat more then we are wont to doe at the preferment and honour of our beſt friends.</p>
                  <p>Beſides wee muſt deſire, that whatſoeuer is in the world may
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:14934:320"/>obey him, loue him, deſiring it a thouſand waies, and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand waies procuring it. And further in the diſcourſe of the minde, meditating a thouſand waies of glory, greatneſſe and ſeruice which are due vnto God; that wee may wiſh them all for him, and that becauſe he is God and for his onely goodneſſe. For all equity requires, that we loue ſo great a LORD, by all the meanes that can bee thought on. Seeing then there is no higher end then GOD himſelfe, who is the beginning and end of all, it followes that he ought to bee loued, not for that chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wee receiue from him or for that wee expect, but for himſelfe who is infinitly amiable.</p>
                  <p>This is that which I ſay and would haue obſerued, that wee ſhould ſo accuſtome our wills, which our ſelues alſo may feele that they may bee mooued to loue, and that they may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in the glory and riches of
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:14934:320"/>our God, not for the ſweetneſſe they perceiue to be in his loue, not for the gifts, which either they haue receiued, or hope to receiue, but that theſe being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, they may loue him, as the moſt worthy to haue all the wils of Angels and men herein exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, that they may deſire and be delighted, that his Maieſty hath all that good which it hath, albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it it nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhould thence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to them, although indeed ſo much more will returne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs by how much wee loue him without any reflexion to our ſelues.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2 This holy loue hath his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning progreſſe &amp; perfection, and albeit at the beginning it giues no great tokens of it ſelfe, which may be felt in the ſoule; yet it is then of greateſt worth, and ſhall after a fewe daies ſhew ſome ſignes of it ſelfe, when it ſhall haue begun to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe. The true experiment and certaine ſigne of this loue,
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:14934:321"/>is, when as the louer loueth God as well when he ſhewes himſelfe fierce againſt him, as when he is more milde, as well when he cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſeth in iuſtice, as when he che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth in mercy. He that is ſuch, loues not, for that God is ſweete and good, yet loues that ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and goodneſſe, becauſe God giues it, and giues him a minde, more diligently to ſerue him. Hee is not affraide at his chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but takes it with that loue, which the pious and princely hand of him that laies in on him, requires. Hee doth not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate and petition, drawne on with deſire or ſweetneſſe of the benefit deſired, but that his ſoule inriched with vertues, may bee increaſed in ſtrength, that he may more diligently and feruently ſerue the Lord, who beſtowed thoſe benefits. Hee is not in any indignation, that ſometimes hee ſees himſelfe voide of conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, yet grieues, if any thing be in him that may offend the eyes
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:14934:321"/>of ſo great a Maieſty, and ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate him from it. Hee deſires not therefore to bee pardoned that he may eſcape the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or may recouer the loſt grace and vertues, or right vnto the Kingdome of glory, but that his ſoule hauing receiued pardon may bee to GOD more accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, may loue him, and pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſerue his moſt high God and Creator.</p>
                  <p>He that is ſuch, hath no affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that drawes his heart any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way. Hee remembers not, nor markes whether men thinke of him. He grieues not, when he perceiues himſelfe be held of no worth. He flees and is ſad at the honours done him, fearing leaſt they may be a hinderance to his humility. Hee reioyceth at the good and honours of others, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that euen honours may be to them as being more ſtrong, a furtherance mote feruently to ſerue GOD, deſiring without all fiction of vanity, that other
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:14934:322"/>men may take an example of good workes at him. Hee that is ſuch, hath all things, and yet hath no thing, hee ſubmits him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to all men and all doe ſerue him: He flees all ſweeteneſſe &amp; contentme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; yet feeles nothing but that which is pleaſing vnto him. In that great God which hee loueth, hee knoweth what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer hee ought to doe, ſay or thinke, and that hee both ſaith, doth and thinketh for him alone. Happy is the man which ſo loueth, it is not he that liueth, but Chriſt liueth in him;<note place="margin">Gal. 2.</note> giuing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him grace to liue a diuine life. This man in louing himſelfe, lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not himſelfe but the moſt high, for whoſe loue, he deſireth euery good thing. Let vs giue one example, whereby as much as may be, we may behold when we doe thus loue God.</p>
                  <p>Say there were a ſonne whoſe father were a verie honeſt man, but verie poore, from whom the ſonne expected nothing,
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:14934:322"/>nor needed it, and yet ſhould ſo ſerue this father, as that he pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced all his ioye and delight in him rather then in himſelfe, and reioyced more to bee delighted in his father then in himſelfe, and all things which bring any honour or ioy, which hee doth or are offred vnto him, hee ſo much reioyceth that they are offered, as hee thinketh his father will reioyce for them: and on the other ſide is more afflicted by any occurring ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity, for the griefe that his father will thence conceiue, then for his owne puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. So that when this ſonne is ſicke, hee ſuffers more paine, for the affliction and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row which hee ſees his father ſuffer, ſeeing his ſonne ſicke, then for his owne griefe: and when hee growes ſound, is more ioyed of the ioy his father doth thence conceiue then of his own health.</p>
                  <p>In like maner, in things which
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:14934:323"/>in the world bring honour, as egregrious ſtratagems and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies of warre, or exerciſes of learning; he deſires to doe them with commendations, becauſe his father lookes vpon them, and reioyceth at them more then for his owne honour: and one the other ſide, if hee doe not theſe things aright, would thence take more griefe, then for his owne diſpraiſe. All this loue and will hath this ſonne towards his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, prouiding for him all things which are neceſſary for him, by no other reflexe, then for the great loue which from his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy he beareth towards his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>This example muſt he that will ſerue God, from day to day of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten reuolue in his minde, at the leaſt for two or three monthes. For herein is declared, ſo much as may ſerue for our purpoſe to ſet fourth the manner of the true loue of God, not hunting after our owne profit, which courſe
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:14934:323"/>we ought to obſerue. Our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Father is God, and wee his ſonnes out of his magnificent gift and grace. Hee ſtands no need of our goods, but we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not want his good; in a farre different manner from this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that I haue ſpoken of, with his ſonne. For there the father was rich, and the ſonne his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, and therefore ſo much the more is the loue of the ſonne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his father to be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
                  <p>Let vs therefore reioyce that the Maieſty of our eternall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is ſo great, that he ſtands no neede of vs, knowing that our obligation is greater vnto him then of that ſonne to his father: Let therefore our loue at the leaſt be like that of this ſonne, and our ſoules ſo farre ſubiected, vntill they finde and feele no ioy of all the good they doe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, but ſo far as we ſhall know that by this we doe God ſeruice. And whatſoeuer we ſhall doe,
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:14934:324"/>muſt be done with great ioy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we beleeue, (and ſo it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) that the diuine Maieſty is wel pleaſed with it, &amp; al the grief which we feele by the infirmity of ſin muſt be, for that it is againſt the wil of God. And the Prophet doth witneſſe that God reioiceth at our ſeruice: God is well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with his people,<note place="margin">Pſal. 149.</note> the praiſes of God are in their mouthes. And that by our ſins he ſeemes as if he were grieued, God himſelf teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: <hi>it repenteth me, that I haue made man.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 6.</note> Now it is to be obſerued, that if the aduerſary of mankinde do much impugne the ſeruants of God in euery vertue wherein he ſeeth they deſire to profit, he will much more ſet vpon them, when he ſeeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hunt after this moſt high kind of loue. Amongſt al his diuerſe impugnations &amp; aſſaults, there is one, as very ſecret, ſo no leſſe hurtfull wherewith he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugneth and oppoſeth many, and that is tepidity and cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of minde, which many doe
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:14934:324"/>feele whileſt they thinke on, read or heare, the chiefe point wherin conſiſts this heauenly loue, namely, that the being, glory, and all the good things of God ſhould be deſired for God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Concerning which we muſt conſider two things. 1. what it is that cauſeth ſo excellent a thing, to wax cold, &amp; to come to ſuch an aguiſh fit: ſeeing it is that diuine heate it ſelfe. 2. What remedy is to bee applied to this diſeaſe? For the 1. we will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe it by this compariſon. If being induced to behold ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which is of great value, it come to paſſe by the defect of our knowledge, that the ſame thing doe ſeeme vnto vs to be of ſmall eſtimation and worth, vndoubtedly wee finde that our appetite growes cold whereby wee deſired to ſee it, albeit in truth the thing bee of as much worth as it was firſt commended for.</p>
                  <p>The ſame thing befalleth many
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:14934:325"/>in this ſame loue of God, whilſt they both ſlenderly behold the thing they loue, and the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary beſides ſets vpon them, which thing chiefely chanceth vnto them who are preuented with that ſweetneſſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment which this loue vſually bringeth with it: who hearing that this loue conſiſts herein, that we doe deſire and inwardly feele in our ſelues a complacency and pleaſure from all the good and glory which is in God, waxe very cold, thinking that this worke is not ſo high and excellent, and iudging that there are other things as well corporall as ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall which may be had, more ſublime and worthy, imagining many things which they iudge to be of more price, and that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the ſeruants of ſo great a Lord to doe them, as workes of great corporall fortitude, as for the point; with one ſhock to caſt down ſome mighty tower, with one blow of a ſword to cut in
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:14934:325"/>ſunder ten ſquadrons of ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Againe to ſhew ſome great ſigne of knowledge as to the purpoſe; if one ſhould make all the Heathens vſing all the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and knowledge they haue, to be ſpeechleſſe: or ſome other great wonders, which are of great admiration in the world, as continuall contemplation, the working of miracles, prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying, and ſuch things which are thought by thoſe that are thus tempted, to be of much more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, then to lift vp the ſoule to God, that it may reioyce that in God is all good and glory which he hath, and therefore they waxe cold in directing all that they are to doe in this life to this onely end, to attaine to that loue, which in their eyes ſeemes not ſo excellent a thing, albeit they beleeue it to bee ſuch becauſe the ſacred Scripture affirmes it, and they do almoſt admire that God will prefer this loue before all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things that can be done.</p>
                  <pb n="552" facs="tcp:14934:326"/>
                  <p>But it is to bee conſidered, that as the appetite and deſire of hurfull and loathſome things, for the moſt part proceeds vnto the ſicke from one and the ſame roote, namely from the infection and corruption of the palate: ſo it commeth to paſſe in him who doth value theſe ſignes of great corporall fortitude to be of much worth: and this loue of GOD not to bee of any ſuch eſteeme: for this proceeds from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected pallate of the ſoule, as hath beene ſaid in the fourth inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and from the aſſaults and temptation of Sathan. Yet is not good meate more vile, then euill meate, nor the loue of God leſſe excellent then other workes, but much more glorious and pretious.</p>
                  <p>Yet doth ſuch coldneſſe bring no ſmall benefit to ſuch as are fraile: for neither doth the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the worke inuite them, ſeeing they perceiue it not, nor yet the taſte of the thing adde
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:14934:326"/>any ſtrength vnto them, and from the one and the other of theſe it commeth to paſſe that in their labours their ſtrength is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectiue. Therefore: it is. 2. fit that we indeauour to apply ſome remedies to this ſoare, hauing already ſeene the cauſes of this coldneſſe. The firſt remedy and moſt common to cure this mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, is to prouide that the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt appetite (as in the 4. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction) may be healed: and by and by thoſe who before felt that coldneſſe ſhall perceiue their former workes which they iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be admirable, to bee indeed very abiect if they bee compared to the loue of God.</p>
                  <p>This doth the Apoſtle, whoſe palate was moſt ſound, teach vs, ſaving, <hi>If I ſpeake, with the tongue of men and Angels,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Cor 13.</note> 
                     <hi>it I giue all my goods to the poore, if I giue my body to be burned and haue not loue it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits mee nothing;</hi> and yet muſt not theſe bee iudged to bee of ſmall moment. But beſides after all
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:14934:327"/>theſe, ſpeaking of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſublime workes, hee affirmes them all to be of leſſe value then loue. The ſame hath the Sonne of GOD himſelfe taught, as wee haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid. Therefore it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that loue is the chiefeſt of all workes and duties, ſeeing without it all other things are nothing. And without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proofe, this ought to ſuffice vs that the eternall wiſdome of God which cannot lie, hath wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, choſen and commanded vs to doe this before all other things that can bee done in heauen or earth.</p>
                  <p>Nothwithſtanding. 2. There is another remedy more ſingular which will make vs ſomething feele the inexplicable greatneſſe of this worke of the loue of God: and the meanes hereof is, that wee vnite and moſt ſtrongly glue our wills to that will which is of infinit excellency, and that we ioyne them in that manner that it be caried to nothing elſe,
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:14934:327"/>but vnto that which that infinit will would haue it; for then ſhal our wills be of much value, when our owne will being abandoned, they haue the wills of that infinit will which is God himſelfe: for he euermore willleth, loueth, and reioiceth for the infinit good which he himſelfe hath. Beſides for many cauſes, God would haue vs to deſire that which hee ſo greatly deſireth.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1 For his onely goodneſſe, whereby hee vouchſafeth to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limate our wills vnto ſo great no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, that they ſhould be in his ſight of great worth.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2 Seeing he hath created vs to ſo great a good, it is iuſt that wee doe him ſome ſeruice: but what duty can we doe him, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Maieſty hath no need of our ſeruice, although it were the greateſt that can bee imagined. Wee ſay therefore, that leaſt wee ſhould be idle, ſeeing God hath no neede of any thing nor can haue more good then now hee
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:14934:328"/>hath, it is very iuſt, that we as the obſequious and dutifull ſeruants of ſo great a Lord, all our liues long be herein imploied, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce at the good and glory of God himſelfe: and indeed euery one may eaſily ſee, that it is moſt iuſt and of great weight, that all things as well in heauen as earth, (omitting all other things) ſhould euermore be herein exerciſed, to reioyce at the good and glory wherwith God is infinitly filled.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3 That for which God would aboue all other things haue our wills vnited vnto him, is; for that being yet on the earth, we ſhould begin to ſeeke that infinit will, from the fulfilling wherof all the bleſſedneſſe which wee haue, or hope for in the heauens is deriued vnto him that is lead with this loue. For it is true that learned Diuines do ſay: that <hi>gloria nihil aliud eſt quam gratia conſummata:</hi> glorie is nothing die but grace <hi>conſummate:</hi> to poſſeſſe chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie here in a meaſure, is to bee
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:14934:328"/>glorified there in abundance: and ſo it is begun here, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected hereafter.</p>
                  <p>But it is to our purpoſe to ſhew how this glory which is heauenly, may be perfected by this loue, wherein the excellency of this loue will appeare. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee muſt conſider, which is alſo againe and againe to be read and pondered, that all our ioy proceeds from the fulfilling of our owne wiſs, and by how much more our will deſireth any thing, and by how much more perfectly it fulfils that which it deſireth, by ſo much doth it obtaine a greater ioy. To theſe things, let vs conſider that the bleſſedneſſe, or perfect ioy in heauen proceeds from the viſion &amp; beholding of God, who in the ſame moment, wherein he is ſeene, infuſeth into all that ſee him, a moſt perfect knowledge, that he is moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to haue all the good and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit glory which he hath.</p>
                  <p>For aſſoone as they ſee him, they
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:14934:329"/>become all prudent and wiſe, ſo that euery one may ſee what is conuenient for him: to which knowledge of God is ioyned the loue of God aboue all created things, together with an ineffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deſire that hee may poſſeſſe all the good and glory which he is worthy of: which deſire and moſt intenſe and inlarged will of euery man, this cleere viſion of God doth ſucceed, whereby they know and ſee apparantly that the ſame their deſire is farre more perfectly fulfilled, then they are able to comprehend. For they ſee and vnderſtand God himſelfe whom they ſo much loue, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with ſo great good and glory, that for the infinities of it they are not able perfectly to vnderſtand, nor yet are able to come to die defects or increaſe of the glory. And againe, that ſo much is euery ones ioy the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by how much his deſire is greater and more perfectly fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>

                     <pb n="559" facs="tcp:14934:329"/>
And here is opened the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the glory of the bleſſed, ſeeing their deſire in ſuch a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime manner is fulfilled, as that nothing can bee more excellent: beſides, that deſire is of, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit good of GOD himſelfe, whom they doe more loue and deſire, then they doe the glorie which properly belongs to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. Bleſſed is the man, who on earth ſhall with an intimous will loue and contemplate the being &amp; glory of God, ſeeing he ſhall thereby obtaine, that hee may ſee his owne deſire in as high a manner to bee fulfilled in heauen. Who is he that can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine how much of his glory the Lord, (without any diminution of glory in himſelfe) ſhall giue vnto him, who dwelling on earth, wiſheth nothing elſe, but the glory and greatneſſe which that Maieſty poſſeſſeth? all theſe things doc thoſe words of <hi>Paul</hi> well declare, <hi>Eye hath not ſeene,</hi>

                  <p>Beſides, it ſhall yet incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably be a greater good, if we ſhal conſider, that for this ſhort time of loue ſhall be rendered an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of grace, and further alſo an augmentation of perpetuall loue together with Celeſtiall glory. And how great a good that is, hee ſhall know, who vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands what is the greatneſſe of diuine loue. And this being knowne, it will yet more cleere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeace, that wee ought euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, or by inumerable viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, to performe this ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime a duty of loue , that doing here that which is our duety wee may increaſe in ſtrength to doe the ſame in heauen: where thoſe that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And wee muſt doe this, with an humble Prayer vnto GOD, ſupplicating his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to ſtrengthen verthe both in body and ſoule, whereby, hauing receiued power to. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt our frailty, for which, by the defect of our power it was neceſſary for vs to flee perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions,

                  <p>And that wee may the more cleerely know how worthy theſe our negligences are of reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, whereby wee fall from this pretious loue; it will be to good purpoſe to obſerue that which wee haue written before of the hatred of our ſelues which is the foundation and primary diſpoſition to this loue of God.

                  <p>From all theſe is to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, what great madneſſe it is not to procure that great glory in heauen, ſeeing the ſublimity of that glory doth neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,

But that we may ſee how we may be able often to loue, chiefely when the taſte in ſweetneſſe forſakes vs, which of it ſelfe was wont to ſtir vs vp; we muſt take a helpe from the ſixth Inſtruction; ſeeing God giues grace to the will to incline to this or that as often as the ſeruant of God ſhall prepare himſelf therunto, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al which the ſeruant of Chriſt may obſerue, what an infinit and irrecouerable loſſe we receiue when wee omit to loue God in euery moment of time wherein wee may loue him.

                  <p>Surely God is ſo potent, that he can at one leape place a man in the higheſt roome of the world: yet he that leapes is to feare, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſometimes he ſhall thinke himſelfe to be lead of God, when indeed he is lead by his own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.

But when he ſhall ſee himſelfe rightly or ſufficiently at leaſt exerciſed herein, if the Lord be pleaſed to helpe him with the bleſſings of ſweetneſſe, they ſhall bee a great helpe vnto him, to loue with facility.

                  <p>Let him briefly call to minde, how great that good and glory is which God hath, conſidering him, as the beſt and moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, that all men ſhould ioy at his good: and preſently let him incline his will, to deſire the ſame thing, and to reioyce at that ſo great good of God, &amp; let him perſiſt in that will as long as he can.

From the long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this exerciſe, hee muſt needs be lifted vp to that moſt high loue. Nor is it any other

                  <p>And one may ſo exerciſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in theſe acts (albeit that ſweetneſſe which they call deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be a wanting) that in euery buſineſſe and in euery place, hee may loue God not needing here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto any ſecret place, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſequeſtration of himſelf: as it daily falleth out, that a friend re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyceth, whilſt he heares, that of late ſome good thing hath befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len his friend, &amp; ſo ſuddenly ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at it without ſeeking any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, place or ſequeſtration.

                  <p>Whence we collect how theſe acts ought to bee produced, and that it all muſt bee done, for that GOD is moſt worthy, that wee ſhould doe it for him. Nor ought it to ſeeme a labour

For in euery of the acts of them, is found a new ſeruice and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.</p>
                  <p>And ſeeing ſometimes it fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth out, that thoſe who indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour

                  <p>There is another worke like vnto this, which God would haue vs to doe, that is, to loue our neghbours: but yet albeit God would haue vs to doe it,

                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore it is fit that wee diſcourſe a little hereof, how he hath loued vs, that wee may vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand in what manner hee would haue vs loue our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. This our great God, loued vs, reducing vs to the ſublime loue of himſelfe: hee loued vs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to ſuffer the aduerſities and afflictions of the world, neuer letting looſe the raines of our affections to the vaine pleaſures of this world, beyond that
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:14934:340"/>which ſhould be neceſſary to the ſuſtentation of the body: hee loued vs dying for vs that hee might giue vnto vs grace and glory.</p>
                  <p>And in this manner of louing was hee moſt of all giuen to loue &amp; the greateſt enemy that could bee, of all vaine loue, wherewith louers doe loue one another, and whereof they make outward ſhew; which kind of loue is very ſlippery &amp; deceitfull. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God is earneſtly to be praied vnto, that this loue may not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the will which was created to be the temple of God. Sure it is, if this loue had not infected the will, the Son of God would neuer haue ſaid, hee that hateth not his father and mother, brethren and ſiſters, cannot bee my diſciple. Therefore wee ought to loue one another, and in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner which our Maſter Ieſus Chriſt hath taught vs, caſting away all other vanities which are wont to mixe themſelues
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:14934:341"/>with loue: whereof, this that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth is one.</p>
                  <p>It commeth to paſſe that thou ſeeſt one in reſpect of the ſoule much giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vertue, &amp; in reſpect of his corporal preſence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation very acceptable and pleaſant: with this perſon many are ſo cordiatly affected, that they become captiued with the loue of him, and it is grieuous vnto them not to ſee him, not to ſpeake with him, not to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in him a reciprocal loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them: this is a vaine loue. Whence with many it falleth out, that they take great paines, but profit very little, and do vnto God very ſmall ſeruice. But let vs make the vanity of it appeare by a familiar example. Thou haſt a friend happily who hath a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, the loue of this ſeruant of thy friends doth ſo captiuate thy heart, that it pleaſeth thee much more to conuerſe and talke with him then with thy friend. If thou ſhalt ſay, that the loue
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:14934:341"/>wherewith thou loueſt this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant is for thy friend, who will not laugh at it? For although it may be, that this loue was begun, in that hee was thy friends ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, yet that from whence this loue ſo increaſed, that thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightedſt more in his conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then thy friends, doth ſhew that now thou loueſt him not for thy friends ſake, but becauſe his conuerſation it pleaſant and acceptable vnto thee: in like manner, wee may ſay, that it is worthy of laughter, that thou ſhouldeſt ſay, the loue whereof wee ſpake before was for Gods ſake, although happily it might haue ſome part of ſpirituall loue in it: but it ſufficeth not him that is truely addicted vnto God, to giue part vnto God, but the whole, ſo that the whole af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection muſt be imploied in God, or in that which is wholy direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him.</p>
                  <p>Therefore whatſoeuer is vaine in this loue muſt bee caſt away,
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:14934:342"/>ſeeing it is certaine, that nothing can bee ordered and directed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, which is more loued in the creature then in God the Creator.

And to the caſting away of theſe things, it ſhall not profit a little to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what wee haue ſpoken before of vaine ioy together with the ſixth Inſtruction.</p>

To loue our ſelues is a thing ſo naturall, that whoſoeuer would hereof write, may wel do it without feare of prouoking any to anger, ſeeing our appetite doth increaſe in our loue towards our ſelues, that albeit, we be inriched with great riches, yet doe wee iudge them but ſmall, becauſe we loue our ſelues &amp; labour aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to greater matters. For this cauſe our excellent Maſter the Sonne of God deſiring that wee ſhould loue our neighbours ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much, as thoſe for whom hee laid down his life; that he might ſhew in few words how much hee would haue vs to loue them; he gaue this rule: <hi>Thou ſhalt loue thy neighbour as thy ſelfe.</hi>

                  <p>Therefore we will ſay that he

Of theſe three ſeeing wee haue often ſpoken in this diſcourſe, we will onely touch ſome few things, which are more neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to bee knowne, that wee may learne aright to loue our ſelues.</p>

                  <p>Let vs obſerue, that euery one whilſt hee loueth himſelfe, doth greatly deſire to better either his ornaments, or elſe all his houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold furniture and all things elſe that he hath if it be not ſuch as he would haue it: and ſo muſt he do who ſpiritually loueth himſelfe. For our Lord God hath giuen vs
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:14934:346"/>a pretious ornament or pearle, wherewith at all times to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich our ſelues. This pearle wee haue, but couered with braſſe or copper, whilſt wee deſire any thing to our owne good or profit: nor muſt wee euer reſt, vntill by the right hand of the higheſt, there bee ſuch a change made, that our appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, which is euer agitated and toſſed vp and downe in vs, wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our owne profit, may now onely regarde thoſe things, wherewith GOD is deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, chiefely that thing being ſuch as that not onely GOD would that wee ſhould haue it, but alſo that we our ſelues ſhold be more inriched with it. For the more wee doe forget our owne proper benefit, that wee may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord it call to minde the glory of God: the more care hath hee of inriching vs with al good things, this forgetfulneſſe is worthy of eternall memory: this remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance worthy of eternall glory.
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:14934:346"/>What a moſt pretious loue is this which maketh men Gods?

                  <p>Of which and or euery other thing which we ſhall relate, ſpeak or heare, wee muſt feele a new motion of ioy; ſuch as worldly men doe feele, whilſt they ſee themſelues or thoſe whom they moſt loue to be commended. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then that they doe vainely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce at the commendations which are not due vnto them, it is very iuſt, that the ſeruant of God ſhould mightily reioyce at his praiſe, whom heauen and earth ſuffice not ſufficiently to praiſe.</p>

Euen as, if ſome of the Kings chiefe ſeruants ſhould reioyed, that they had receiued ſome great benefit from the King that from thoſe greater riches, they might doe him greater and more acceptable ſeruices, without reſpect of other benefits or gifts. Nor is it any other thing to giue God thankes, (which thing many know not) then an inward act of the ſoule, whereby hee who hath receiued the gift or benefit from him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging that God is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit Lord, from whom comes c<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery good thing, reioyceth at all the glory of God, and that by ſuch gift, hee ſees himſelfe more apt, the more to loue and ſerue him.</p>

and by how much that which is ſaid, is inlarged, ſeeing it is a thing of great moment, wee may obſerue that beſides this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognition and ioy ſpoken of, at the receipt of euery benefit from God, wee ought to offer vnto God, all that wee are: in our owne wills annihilating our ſelues, whereby we may giue our ſelues wholy in body and ſoule to his ſeruice, producing then moſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And that wee may more clearely vnderſtand that which I now ſpeake of anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilating our ſelues: I would hereby ſignifie, that ſeeing wee may euer increaſe in the diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and deſpiſing of our ſelues, we ought as oft as we giue tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks vnto God, after a ſingular maner, to diſ-eſteeme of our ſelues in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his benefits, whereby we may the better giue our ſelues
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:14934:348"/>to his Maieſty. Therefore the ſeruant of God muſt be very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to himſelfe that as often as he giues thanks to God for any benefit, that motion of the mind, &amp; that will, wherby he reioiceth at the benefit receiued, do actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally proceede (as before is ſaid) that he may loue God the more &amp; ſerue him; reiecting all confidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this, that hence it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth vnto him whereby hee may of good from him that he knoweth may come vnto him, thence ſo be made more ſtrong in the loue of GOD alone, and more accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table thankes may bee rendred vnto him: and he muſt alſo haue the eyes of his ſoule open, for ſometimes theſe things will fall out not without ſome defects, and we will thinke that al things are rightly done.</p>
                  <p>But the ground-worke of that which hitherto is ſpoken, is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from that which Diuines &amp; Prophets are wont to ſay, that he who would be thankful, muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne

Therefore at the leaſt wee ought to giue him thankes for them in this manner, as we haue ſpoken, and that with as much affection and indeauour as we are able. By this very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our vnderſtanding and will, and by all the foreſaid pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of our annihilation, we muſt euery day giue thankes, for ſo great a benefit beſtowed on vs: namely that he that great Maieſty hath receiued to himſelf ſo great good as he hath.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame manner muſt wee giue like dayly thankes vnto him for the benefit of his Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, our Redemption and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the whole world. For the benefits conferred vpon

Oh how truely doth he loue himſelfe, who is euer imployed in this giuing of thankes. For aſſuming as his owne, euery good thing which is done to all others after an ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable manner, it cauſeth his own proper good to increaſe, yea it makes the good of all others to bee his owne proper good; and by ſo much more doth his owne good increaſe, by how much hee doth more reioyce in the onely loue of God; and giues him thankes for all, without all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of ſuch increaſe.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1 For the firſt, namely confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in ſuch caſes there is wont to be a common refuge whereby they comfort &amp; animate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, conſidering that others happily did not ſo much obſerue that word or deed of theirs, as he that did or ſaid it, doth thinke; or if they did ſo obſerue it, yet that themſelues as well as others haue fallen often into ſuch like defects, or elſe that now they haue forgotten it. Thus doe they who coldly loue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</p>
                  <p>But thoſe who ſoundly loue themſelues doe quite contrary, namely imbracing that confuſion with great loue, conſidering that others will deſpiſe them, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

                  <p>And if we be attentiue; there is daily an occaſion offred vnto vs, either of operation or cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, whereby wee may doe theſe things, all which things they doe looſe that without me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode and negligently lead their liues, albeit, they thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues deuout. But how much hee who truely loues himſelfe ought to eſteeme euery of theſe acts, the ſeruant of God will very well obſerue; turning himſelfe as well to this place, as to the things before diſcourſed, in

That the ſorrowfull ſoule might returne vnto him, and bee admitted againe, moſt louingly into the bed and boſome of his moſt ſweet familiarity. For thus he wooes it: thou haſt commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted fornication with many lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, yet returne vnto me ſaith the Lord, and I will receiue thee. By theſe or ſuch like meditations, which are euery where to bee ſeene, thou maiſt eaſily ſhake off all ſloathfulneſſe, and ſtirre vp thy ſelfe to deuotion. Nor doe I thinke any long time requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red hereunto; becauſe the minde, being warned by the morning praier, and by the care of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine preſence (of which after) doth eaſily collect it ſelf, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a man to celebrate the holy Communion with all due and poſſible deuotion.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4 The laſt point of prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is the vſe of praier: which muſt be generall for all men,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2.</note> but

I worſhip thee as my God with my whole heart and with al my ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth; humbly praying thee in the merites of my Sauiour Chriſt, that all my thoughts, my deſires, words and workes may be now &amp; euer acceptable vnto thee, &amp; that thou will heare my praiers, and for thy mercies ſake not without comfort diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch them from thee.</p>
                  <p>I thank thee, O fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tain of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, for the innumerable great benefits which fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of my conception vntill this inſtant houre, I haue receiued of thy bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ty: for the infinit benefits which eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now at this very time I receiue from thee: for thoſe infinit benefits which euen vnto the ende of my life and for all

For I am O Lord without all compariſon leſſe then leaſt of thy mercies: vnworthy altogether, whom thou ſhouldeſt remember, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteine, or comfort with the leaſt of thy benefits.</p>
                  <p>But now eſpecially, moſt deere Father and mercifull God: I giue thee thanks fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bottome of my heart. Firſt, for the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit riches which thou haſt pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the humanity of thy onely begotten Sonne, my Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and becauſe thou haſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him vnto mee for a Father, a Teacher, a Guide and a Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. Secondly, for that great plenty of benefits, wherewith thou haſt not onely inriched me, but alſo all thoſe whom by thy effectuall grace, through the whole Church, thou calleſt to ſanctification and newneſſe of life, and admitteſt to thy moſt ſweete familiarity. Thirdly, alſo
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:14934:373"/>I thanke the moſt deere Father, euen with all the ſtrength of my minde, for this thy great merey, in taking me from the miſeries of this world, wherein many of thy ſeruants farre more worthy then I, are plunged, in calling mee to the knowledge of thy great name, and graunting mee ſo many helps to ſerue thee as I haue. Fourthly, for all the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents and guifts both Naturall, Spirituall and Temporall beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on mee, that by them I might profitably ſpend my time, helpe others according to my calling and power, and diſpoſe my ſelfe, by thy mercy, to attaine eternall felicity. Fifthly, for this viciſſitude and change of conſolations and deſolations, of proſperities and aduerſities, wherewith thou haſt wonderfully wouen and ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned my life, that neither through continuall aduerſity I ſhould bee caſt downe, nor yet by aſſiduity of proſperity I ſhould be made drunke. Sixthly, for this ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable

                  <p>And now, O my Lord God, being animated with theſe and other thy innumerable benefits, I preſume humbly to ſue for more. Giue mee Lord and all that now are prepared for this heauenly feaſt,<note place="margin">Matth. 15</note> 
                     <hi>this day, our dayly bread.</hi> It is not good, O my God, to take the childrens bread and giue it vnto dogs, but though this be ſo, yet ſometimes the whelps doe eate of the crummes which fall from their Maſters table. Therefore albeit I am in thy houſe like a deſpicable whelpe, yet this day by thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, let mee feed on the bread of thy children, and furniſh my ſoule with all graces which may make me worthily to taſte of thy
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:14934:374"/>ſupper. Giue me thy moſt abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant grace, that I may come to this my Redeemers ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quet, with ſuch aſſured faith, profound hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, due reuerence, humble feare, feruent charity, conſtant hope, and thirſting affections, that I may there appeare to bee welcome vnto thee, and may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue into my ſoule, all the fruits of this thy moſt heauenly Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe, O my ſweete Father, Sauiour and Sanctifier, this is a ſeruice wherewith thou art well pleaſed, and by which thou conueieſt vnto vs the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe Ocean of all thy mercies and graces; I will now powre out my heart further in thy ſight: and becauſe thy Sonne my Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our is omnipotent, I will for his infinit merits ſake pray vnto thee for all men.</p>
                  <p>Be mercifull therfore, O Father of al mercies, to the whole world and repleniſh it with thy faith and knowledge, turning the
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:14934:375"/>Nations which are voide of faith to the knowledge of the truth in thy Sonne Chriſt Ieſus. Turkes, Barbarians, Heretiques, Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, Idolaters, and the perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Iewes, compell them now at length to enter into the houſe of the Church. Let not ſo many millions created in thy image, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh: Let not that moſt pretious bloud of thy Sonne be ſhed for them in vaine, I lament, O Lord, before thee, theſe my brethren thus eſtranged from thee, and the miſerable condition wherein they lie intangled; and if I could, I would beleeue in thee with all the vnderſtandings of theſe people, I would loue thee with all their willes, and I would perpetually ſerue thee, with all their ſtrengths. But, alas, I can doe nothing but deſire and lament, and powre out my laments and deſires before thy great Maieſty.</p>
                  <p>Haue mercy, O Lord, vpon thy whole Church, increaſe in it
<pb n="651" facs="tcp:14934:375"/>the purity of faith, and cleanneſſe of ſanctification, and extend it by the labour of thy good and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſeruants to the ends of the whole world. Behold with the eye of thy mercy, thy righteous ones, thoſe that labour more and more for a further meaſure of ſanctification, preſerue and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in them true righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: Behold all miſerable ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners lying and ſtinking in the puddle of their ſinnes, draw them vnto thee, and take them by a mighty hand out of that ſo miſerable an eſtate. Helpe, Lord, all thoſe paſtours of thy flocke, and giue them grace that both by word and example they may ſhine vnto all men, and their light may guide and direct others to ſaluation. O Lord, make them the ſalt of the earth, the light of this cloudy world, the cities placed vpon a high hill, and giue them grace not onely to aſpire vnto, but to attaine that purity of life, that zeale of thy
<pb n="652" facs="tcp:14934:376"/>glory, which their place and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity requires. O Lord, poure out thy mercies vpon our King and all other Kings and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, nobles, plebeians, and all the whole ranke of ſecular men that call vpon thy name: deliuer them from their aduerſaries, ioyn them together in the peace of thy Goſpell, inrich them with a zeale and care of obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing thy commandements, that they may liue as it becommeth Chriſtians and may obtaine that eternall ſaluation to which they were created. Forget not the kingdoms &amp; principalities of thy Church, but make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more pote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t then their enemies, giue victory to their armies againſt the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of thy faith, &amp; in mercy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow vpon them all neceſſaries for the quiet and comfortable paſſage or this mortall life.</p>
                  <p>I bring before thee, O Lord, my Parents, my Brethren, my kindred, my frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, humbly pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee to giue vnto them all
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:14934:376"/>things which thou ſhalt know to bee agreeable to thy will, and profitable to their ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I bring alſo into thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, all captiues, impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſicke, tempted, troubled, agonizing and wounded ſoules, and all ſuch as are in any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame and grieuous neceſſity, that out of thy goodneſſe they may receiue liberty, health victory, conſolation, a happie death, and a full remedy and recouery of all their neceſſities and wants. Yea I humbly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat thee O moſt mercifull Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for all my enemies, that in all things thou wouldeſt be good vnto them: and that for the infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my which they haue eaſt vpon mee thou wouldeſt giue vnto them honour: for detraction, a good fame; for hatred, loue, and for all the euils practiſed againſt me, all temporall things profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for this life, and in fine eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſaluation.</p>
                  <p>And now, O my God and
<pb n="654" facs="tcp:14934:377"/>onely refuge, I come vnto thee for my ſelfe, and will declare, before thee, my owne neceſſities and miſeries, not that thou maiſt know them, for all things are open and manifeſt vnto thy eyes; but that whilſt with mourning and griefe I pronounce them, I may kindle in my ſelfe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of thy mercy, and may draw from thee, the remedies of my grieſe. I haue ſinned, O Lord, beyond the number of the ſand of the ſea, my iniquities are mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied againſt mee, and I am not worthy ſo much as to behold the heauens, becauſe of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of my ſinnes againſt thee. Yet in confidence of thy ſonnes merits, whoſe bloud was a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ranſom for the ſinnes of the whole world, I begge for his ſake, remiſſion of all my ſinnes, and to be clenſed from all mine iniquities. Graunt vnto mee a ſauing faith to hold faſt on thy promiſes; a true repentance, that for the loue of thee, I may
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:14934:377"/>deteſt all ſinne; and a ſafe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection that I be neuer intang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the ſnares of Sathan. Giue me true mortification of my judgement, will, affections, and ſences, leaſt being deceiued by theſe which are euer prone vnto euill, I bee drawne from thoſe things which are pleaſing vnto thee. Giue me a true contempt of earthly things, that I may nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeeke for honours, nor hunt after dignities, nor deſire riches or pleaſures; but that I may place all my honour, all my treaſures, all my delights in thee, who art the fountaine of all good things. Deliuer mee from all temptations and guiles of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible enemies, but chiefely from them, that come vnder the vizard of good, leaſt ſeeking after that which is good, I ſhould be pulled away from the true good.</p>
                  <p>Grant, O my Lord God, that that faith which thou haſt giuen me, may euermore bee preſerued and increaſed in mee. Lighten
<pb n="656" facs="tcp:14934:378"/>my minde with a ſupernaturall light, that it may know the diuine myſteries, and that it may more perfectly vnderſtand thoſe things which I beleeue concerning thee and thy Sonne. Grant me a firme hope, whereby I may altogether forget my ſelfe and may place all my cares in the boſome of thy prouidence, and that I may conſide, that I ſhall onely out of thy mercy obtaine eternall life, and all things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the attayning therof: giue mee perfect charity, whereby I may moſt ardently loue thee and my neighbours: giue mee a true reſignation of my ſelf and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to thy will. Cheere vp my minde with the preſence of thy goodneſſe; pacifie my ſoule and conſcience with thy peace: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindle me with the zeale of thy glory, and ſaluation of my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: powre into me the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of compaſſion whereby I may compaſſionate and condole the miſeries of others, and according
<pb n="657" facs="tcp:14934:378"/>to my weakeneſſe helpe them.</p>
                  <p>Perfect in me, O my Creator my vnderſtanding with pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and diſcretion, that in all things I may hold a meane: giue mee a docible heart, that I may not frowardly perſiſt in my owne ſence and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Stirre vp in mee a true fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and heate, that I may not ſlackly and coldly, but moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently ſerue thee: and adorne me with the virtue of attentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; circumſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that I may take heed of the euils of my ſoule, which euery where daily lie in waite for me, and that I may doe nothing by my negligence which may bee leſſe acceptable and pleaſing vnto thee.</p>
                  <p>Perfect in me, O Lord, my will, by the power of thy righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, wherby I may willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubmit vnto thy will, and may giue vnto euery one that which is his due. Subiect me to thy ſelfe by the power of Religion, and giue mee the vertue and guift of
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:14934:379"/>prater that in all things I may ſeeke thy praiſe, &amp; giue thee that worſhip which is due to thy great name. Giue mee a heart penitent for my ſinnes, pious to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards my parents, deuoute to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards my betters, ſubiect to my gouernours, thankefull to my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors; affable to my friends, ſimple in deeds, and true in words. Such a heart, I ſay, as may imitate the heart of thy deare Sonne, and may euer offer vp vnto thee an acceptable ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
                  <p>Perfect, O my good Father the iraſcible part of my ſoule, with the vertue of fortitude, ſo that in all aduerſities I may carry my ſelfe as becommeth mee, and preſſed with the burden of afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I may neuer be exorbitant from that which is right in thy eyes. Giue me a minde in mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity conſpicuous, in things of my duety and thy ſeruice, through ſecurity, ioyfull, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning the goods of this
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:14934:379"/>world for thy ſake, ſuſteyning all acerbities and ſorrowes, albeit many and long enduring, and perſeuering conſtantly in that which I haue well begun. For it is the voice of thy Sonne, that not he who hath begun, and left off from his enterpriſe, but hee that continues to the end ſhalbe ſaued.</p>
                  <p>Perfect in me, O my God, my concupiſcible faculty, with the beauty of temperance, whereby I may both flee all filthy things, and follow after honeſt and holy things, and in the care for my body, may onely haue reſpect to my neceſſity.

                  <p>And for this cauſe, is it, that thou receiueſt not the mercies thou often deſireſt, becauſe thou haſt beene ſo vnthankefull for this ſo great a benefit ſo often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued.

It is not reprehenſible that wee inſtantly doe aske, but ſurely it denies the effect of the petition, when we are found vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefull. And happily this may ſeeme to be clemency to deny to the vnthankfull that which they aske: leaſt it might fall out vnto vs, that we ſhould be iudged ſo much more grieuouſly, by how much wee haue been found more vnthankfull for benefits heaped vpon vs. Therefore in this caſe, it is a point of mercy to withdraw mercy; euen as it is a point of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and wrath to ſhew mercy, namely that mercy, of which the father of mercies ſpeakes in the Prophets:<note place="margin">Iſa. 26.</note> Let mercy be ſhewed to the wicked, and hee will not learne righteouſneſſe: therfore let vs bee euer thankfull for this ſo great a benefit, and neuer ſuffer it to paſſe away with out ſome notable thankfulneſſe of heart for it.</p>

                  <p>Wouldeſt thou vainely haue thy knowledge ſet a broach with men? But yet heerein thou

Wilt thou ſatisfie thy curioſity and too much deſire of knowledge? But whilſt thou deſireſt to know, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for knowledge ſake, thou both hurts thy conſcience, and reſiſts the true knowledge which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and mooues thy will. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in knowledge, ſeeke no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but God, and in the acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition and vſe of it, labour not to pleaſe the fooliſh world but the wiſe God.</p>
                  <p>The ſtudies which proceed from ſuch a holy intention will eaſily bee ioyned with vertue: which are two ſiſters that muſt at once bee laboured for. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe knowledge without ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is little or nothing worth, and vertue without knowledge lame. Therefore let thy know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge be full of vertue, and thy vertue ſeaſoned with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that thou wander not in
<pb n="695" facs="tcp:14934:397"/>the way of vertue. But yet there is more care to bee had of vertue then knowledge, which being the end of knowledge, muſt haue the firſt and chiefeſt place in thy heart and care. Therefore wee muſt neuer for the attay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of knowledge omit the actions of vertue. The workes of vertue make vs holy, but the ſtudie of knowledge onely make vs learned. Therefore Sanctity is to bee preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſcience. If after many yeares ſtudie, thou haſt profited ſo much as to become moſt learned, and haſt not profited in vertue and humility. Oh how fooliſh art thou, how little worth, how reproueable, who haſt not onely waſted thy age but all thy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance with harlots, and haſt caſt off thy ſpouſe, moſt worthy of all loue?

Is not this to imbrace ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, to wax proud of knowledge, and from that which was giuen to humble vs,<note place="margin">Ber.</note> to be daily more and more puffed vp? it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore euident, that dignity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowledge is vnprofitable, but knowledge without vertue, damnable.</p>
                  <p>That therfore thy knowledge may not damne thee, nor make thee poore and miſerable, ioyne it with vertue, and to this end onely labour to get knowledge; that euery day thou maiſt bee

                  <p>Onely forget not this: that euermore, thou begin thy ſtudy or reading with praier vnto God who is the God of knowledge,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 2.</note> of whom the cogitations of the heart are prepared; this thou maiſt learne of that godly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who moſt often did ſo ſearch out the truth,<note place="margin">Auguſt Conf. c. 11.</note> as if ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God, and demaunding of him, and as it were wringing from him by praiers the ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of doubts.

Giue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I haue vndertaken to know thee, and it is a great labour vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mee, vntill thou openeſt.</p>
                  <p>For Chriſts ſake I beſeech thee, in his name who is the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt of holies, let no man reproue mee.

                  <p n="1">1 This examination of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, is a ſubtle and exquiſite diſcuſſion, whereby wee doe weigh all our cogitations, words and actions, and doe retract both the good and euill wee haue don. This diſcuſſion is very neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that wee may not become hatefull vnto God, whom wee deſire to pleaſe; for he conſiders
<pb n="715" facs="tcp:14934:407"/>all the thoughts and workes of all men, approouing the good deeds, and condemning the euill: yet doth hee mercifully pardon the euils if wee by examination acknowledge them, and with teares and true repentance waſh them, <hi>What is man,</hi> ſaith <hi>Iob,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iob. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>that thou magnifieſt him, and that thou ſetteſt thy heart vpon him? and doeſt viſit him euery morning and trieſt him euery moment?</hi> I aske what it is, to be magnified and viſited of God, but to bee repleniſhed with his guifts and graces? But what is it for GOD to ſet his heart vpon man, but to obſerue whether hee doe well vſe his guifts, and doe diſcuſſe his owne workes and manners? Is not this the ſame, that the holy man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments vpon this place.<note place="margin">Greg. 8. Mor.</note> GOD magnifieth man, becauſe he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richeth him with largeneſſe of reaſon, viſits him with infuſion of grace, exalts him with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of vertue beſtowed on him. And when hee is of himſelfe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things,
<pb n="716" facs="tcp:14934:408"/>yet out of the bounty of his goodneſſe, graunts him to be partaker of his knowledge.</p>
                  <p>But the Lord ſets his heart vpon man ſo magnified when after thoſe guiftes, hee ſtirres vp his iudgement, and examens vehemently all the moments of life, and after takes of him more diſtrict puniſhments, by how much hee hath more liberally preuented him with his guifs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed.</p>
                  <p>Now theſe euils which God obſerues in vs, prouoke him to wrath, vnleſſe by repentance and deſire of amendement they depart from vs, and then doe wee repent for our ſinnes, when wee deſire and purpoſe to ſhun them, when in the diſcuſſion of the conſcience, wee ſhall vnderſtand, that they are euill and diſpleaſing vnto God. For the euils which either out of ignorance, or infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, or yet or mallice wee haue committed , this diſcuſſion and this examination doth detect, &amp;
<pb n="717" facs="tcp:14934:408"/>ſets them before the eies of the minde, that they may bee lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and blotted out.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the things which we haue committed with more precipitancy then prudence, and feare to be euil, we muſt diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcuſſe, and by a wiſe retracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion inquire whether they be iuſt or vniuſt, profitable or vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Hence wee may collect, that who doe not often exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine themſelues, can ſeldome or neuer haue a right and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied life. For euen as a line is not thought to bee exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant and ſwaruing from straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, when it is look't on with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the helpe of the rule: but aſſoone as the rule is laide to it, the obliquity and crooked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the line is diſcouered; ſo the defects of our liues, do paſſe by and out of our knowledge, whileſt that the Rule of Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination doth not ponder all our workes: For this diſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſion of the Conſcience, is the
<pb n="718" facs="tcp:14934:409"/>rule, which directs our actions, and ſhewes, what is crooked, and what is ſtreight, what is acceptable, and what is odious to God in them.</p>
                  <p>If therefore the rule be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie to Artificers, to the doing of their workes according to arte, ſurely then is the examination of our thoughts and workes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to vs, to the end that wee may liue well, and frame our liues according to the rule of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. When wee doe purpoſe to clenſe a houſe, wee firſt gather and ſweepe all the filth in one place, that wee may afterwards caſt it our. So is the houſe of our conſcience to bee clenſed; exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination gathers our ſinnes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and repentance after that caſts them out. But if by this exerciſe, we doe not ſee our ſins and defects, and gather them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome corner of our memory, euen to our confuſion and teares for them, how ſhall we euer caſt them out?</p>

                     <pb n="719" facs="tcp:14934:409"/>
One doth very aptly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the examination of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, to the moouing of the humours in the body by phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke: for as the art of phyſicke doth firſt by the benefit of ſome medecine, mooue and collect the humours, and afterwards by ſome potion driues them out; ſo the art of holy liuing, doth firſt by examination mooue our ſinnes, and as it were, pull them out of their reſidence, and after by true repentance caſtes them out.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Iud. 6.</note> the Angell of the Lord appeared vnto him; who taught him the will of God, and made him cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to ouercome the <hi>Midianits.</hi> And what is this to threſh wheat and hide it from the <hi>Midianits,</hi> but to examine thy life by a wiſe conſideration, to auoid the ſnares of the diuell? Doth not GOD looking vpon this thy labour, ſend his meſſenger to make thee captaine againſt thy enemies, whilſt thou feeleſt a light ſent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen, to make thee know thy ſins, and ſtirre thee vp by teares and repentance to caſt them out? <hi>What is it to threſh wheate,</hi>
                     <pb n="722" facs="tcp:14934:411"/>ſaith a holy father, <hi>but by ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of iudgement to ſeparate the graines of vertues,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Greg. 3. Mor.</note> 
                     <hi>from the chaffe of vices?</hi> Therefore thoſe that by iudgement and examination ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parato their good deeds either from wicked workes or affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, doe prepare themſelues to receiue the beames of diuine light. At the laſt day when God ſhal iudge the world, he wil firſt examine the conſciences,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 4.</note> and by the examination manifeſt them, that after hee may giue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Godly moſt ample re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and to the wicked moſt bitter torments: becauſe euen nature doth teach, that no man is to bee iudged good or euill, till his cauſe bee knowne of the Iudge. God will ſet before man his ſinnes,<note place="margin">Pſal. 49.</note> hee will write them in his ſight with the pencill of his wiſdome, that hee may know himſelfe guilty, and GOD iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puniſhing him: and the ſame order, if wee will doe aright, muſt wee obſerue, namely firſt,
<pb n="723" facs="tcp:14934:411"/>by a prudent examination, pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all our thoughts and workes, before either wee arraigne our ſelues as guilty, or acquite our ſelues as innocents. For neuer whilſt wee here liue, will there bee awanting in our hearts, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient matter to humble vs and to prouoke vs to a holy repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, except our liues lie hid vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the vaile of ſelfe loue.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Another reaſon of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity hereof is, for that no man can without it, ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue a deteſtation of his ſinnes. For who euer was mooued to deteſt the miſery hee knowes not? Who euer grieues for the ſtripes hee feeles not? Or the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy hee knowes not? ſuch is he who is vtterly ignorant of his defects and miſeries, who doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe will neuer grieue for them, nor by any cenſure of amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will caſt them out. And how ſhall hee not be ignorant of his defects, who neuer lookes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelfe? Who doth not exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<pb n="724" facs="tcp:14934:412"/>and diſcuſſe himſelfe? And who neuer obſerues what hee caries, either in his hands or in his heart? Therefore diſcuſſion of the conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is the beginning of all ſoueraigne ſorrow and repentance, whereby when wee behold our owne caſes and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, wee are ſtirred vp to ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and deteſtation for our ſins. <hi>After that I conuerted, I repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and after I was inſtructed,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ier. 31.</note> 
                     <hi>I ſmote vpon my thigh.</hi> For albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it GOD alone it is that turnes vs vnto him, vnto whom the worke of our conuerſion is to bee aſcribed, as the author of all good, yet ſeeing hee will haue vs in this worke not to bee ſtocks and ſtones, hee beginning this worke, doth not exclude our workes, but in what manner wee are conuerted hee ſhewes, ſaying, <hi>After I was inſtructed I ſmote vpon my thigh;</hi> Firſt wee muſt by attentiue diſcuſſion, knowe our ſinnes and after by due repentance chaſtice them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="725" facs="tcp:14934:412"/>
To conclude, I was aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med yea euen confounded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I did beare the reproach of my youth, <hi>q. d.</hi> thou haſt ſhewed mee my ſinnes, whilſt I ſearched them, and touched with the knowledge of them, I am aſhamed to haue commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, and to haue follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſerued the wicked luſts and affections of my youth. Beholde how the knowledge of ſinnes, which comes by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion, enforceth the heart to griefe: patient <hi>Iob</hi> ſaw not himſelfe. And therefore hee was not aſhamed, but boaſted of his owne innocency, complayning of the miſeries which God brought vpon him: but after that by a more intimous conſideration he look't into himſelfe ſeeing his owne vility, hee laies downe his complaints, and takes vp the countenance of a true penitent. <hi>I haue heard of thee by the hearing of the eare,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iob. 42.</note> 
                     <hi>but now mine eye ſeeth thee;</hi> Therefore I abhorre my
<pb n="726" facs="tcp:14934:413"/>ſelfe and repent in duſt and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes. <hi>q. d.</hi> I now ſee thy wiſdom and the iuſt cauſes of my ſmiting and plagues. And therefore I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue my ſelfe, that ſo boldly durſt pronounce my ſelfe inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and to haue ſuffred without cauſe, I repent for it in duſt and aſhes. So when wee doe not ſee our owne conſciences, we thinke our ſelues righteous, and much better then others, but when by examination wee diſcuſſe them, then wee iudge our ſelues miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſinners. And by how much a man doth ſee himſelfe leſſe, (ſaith a father) by ſo much doth hee diſpleaſe himſelfe leſſe,<note place="margin">Greg. 35. Mor.</note> and the more light of grace hee hath receiued, the more will he know himſelfe to be reprooueable. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee ſhall more clearely ſee how much hee ſwarnes from the rule that is aboue him.</p>
                  <p>And the Prophet tells vs,<note place="margin">Pſal. 59.</note> that this is the cuſtome of God, that hee might by the knowledge of our ſinnes, drawe vs to ſorrow
<pb n="727" facs="tcp:14934:413"/>and repentance for them. Thou haſt mooued the Land and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it, heale the ſoares of the land, for it ſhaketh. in this place it is demaunded; how the Land is troubled and diuided? And he anſweres himſelfe,<note place="margin">Auguſt.</note> 
                     <hi>by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of ſinnes,</hi> a wiſe and true anſwere, for when a man findes in his heart the ſinnes hee knew not before, then is hee pricked in his conſcience, mooued with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, troubled with feare, that hee may bee healed of the Lord by grace. For it is he that pricks, that hee might cheriſh; mooues that hee might quiet; troubles, that hee might by compunction deliuer the troubled minde from the euils for which it is troubled. But if wee doe not diſcuſſe our ſelues, wee ſhould neither know our ſinnes, nor bee mooued by contrition, without which wee can neuer obtaine the pardon of our ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Spirit,</hi> ſaith the Prophet,<note place="margin">Ezech. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>lift me vp and tooke me away, and I

And from whence tooke hee him? But from earthly cares, and troubles of the world, that his owne onely care and buſines might be to know himſelfe, and clenſe himſelfe from ſinnes? There is hee filled with bitterneſſe whilſt hee findes himſelfe leſſe clenſed, and leſſe ſeruent then he ſhould be.

                  <p>Now if our good workes
<pb n="749" facs="tcp:14934:424"/>muſt come vnder this examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, much more muſt our euill and wicked actions bee ſubiect to it. For ſeeing thereby not onely our ſinnes and defects but alſo the quality and greatneſſe of the euill committed, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but mooue it to ſorrow and repentance, which being true and vnfeined, bends the mercy of GOD towards vs and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teines remiſſion in Ieſus Chriſt.<note place="margin">Iſ. 38.</note> What doth the good King that hee might get GOD to bee propitious vnto him? I will walke weakely all my yeres, in the bitterneſſe of my ſoule: where the common tranſlation goeth thus, I will recall all my yeares in the bitterneſſe of my ſoule. All the yeares, ſaith hee, of my life, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member my ſinnes committed againſt thee: and I will ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon this remembrance with grieuous ſorrow and repentance, and becauſe I haue offended thy diuine Maieſtie I will euen
<pb n="750" facs="tcp:14934:425"/>conſume my ſelfe with griefe and affliction. I will ſurely ſay, O Lord, if thus I liue, if thus I muſt ſpend and waſt my daies, if in ſuch, ſo filthy and odious things, ſo vnworthy of man, I ſhall looſe the life of my ſoule, why ſhould I liue? And whilſt I thus ſay, and with griefe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume my ſelfe, feeling thy repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion in my heart, I am by thy mercy brought to life againe. I now ſee, that in the falſe, feig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and hurtfull peace which I had with my ſinnes, there was hidden moſt bitter bitterneſſe. But whilſt I ſee this, and grieue for it, thou, O Lord, who woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt not the death of a ſinner, but that hee might bee turned and liue, haſt taken away and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered my ſoule from that miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable condition of ſinne, that it ſhould not periſh, and haſt caſt behind thy backe all my ſinnes. Theſe fruits did <hi>Ezechias</hi> gather from the recogitation of his ſins. And the ſame ſhall wee alſo doe,

Let thy conſcience iudging and condemning thee ſit quiet, let Iuſtice ſtand as guilty, no man loues thee better, no man will iudge more faithfully. In the morning take an account of thy ſelfe for the night paſt, and giue a Law vnto thy ſelfe for the day come. At night take an account of the paſt, and lay a commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on thy ſelfe for the night to come, ſo ſhalt thou be kept from all wicked and daungerous tranſcurſions and wandrings out of the way. Seeing then all that wee doe muſt be thus diſcuſſed, many of them being by the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God, good, and not a few by
<pb n="752" facs="tcp:14934:426"/>our owne frailty, euill, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower, that all both good and bad muſt appeare before the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that what is good in them, may by the mercy of God be accepted, and what is euill out of our frailty, may through his mercy and our due repentance, be put out and pardoned.</p>
                  <p>Now hauing thus ſeene the matter of our diſcuſſion, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that we ſpeake how it is to be done. We ſay; that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is happy, where the Iudges loue no guifts, nor ſeeke for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, but iudge iuſtly: but more truely is that ſoule happy, in which reaſon illuminated by God, examines all the actions and diſſembles nothing; nor leaues any thing that is vniuſt, without iuſt puniſhment. If then this examen of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience bee a certaine kinde of ſpirituall iudgement, the forme of iudgement moſt be obſerued in it that it be rightly and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably performed of vs.</p>

Now in that iudgement, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a man is not onely accuſed of ſome crime, but alſo of ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude towards him whom by his offence, he hath hurt. 1. There muſt bee a commemoration of the benefit. 2. An inquiſition and probation of the crime. 3. Laſtly a ſentence of the Iudge condemning the guilty, and with due puniſhment cenſuring him.</p>
                  <p>Of this kinde, it ſeemeth, the examen of Conſcience is<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

For as black doth appeare bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter if placed neere vnto that which is white, ſo our ſins being ſet neere to the benefits of God, will more euidently ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.

                  <p>The next thing is, to take a time accommodate and fit for this examen, which may be ſome ſhort time before we prepare our ſelues for ſleepe. There is one time of ſearching out the things that are aboue vs, and another time of diſcuſſing the things that are with in vs. For their is a time for euery thing vnder the Sunne: Therefore there is a time of contemplating the wonderfull workes of God, and there is a time of conſidering our owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities. This is a time of weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but that is a time of laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. For ſorrow may bee for a night but ioy commeth in the morning.<note place="margin">Pſal. 29.</note> Why ſhould there not be a time of laughing in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of diuine contemplation,

And why ſhould there not be a time of weeping in the eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of horrible ſights, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the darkeneſſe of mans conſcience? Therefore in this time of weeping and conſidering our owne darkeneſſe, fiue things are to bee done, which concurre to the forme and manner of this examen. 1. Is a commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the benefits of GOD and an humble and feruent thankſgiuing. 2. A deſire of grace, that wee may bee able, to ſearch out and know our ſinnes and defects. 3. An inquiſition and diſcuſſion of the conſcience, whereby we may acknowledge the ſinnes of omiſſion and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. 4. Sorrow and deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for our ſinnes and a purpoſe of amendment. 5. A due cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring and caſtigation of our ſelues for them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Our examination muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with thankſgiuing for all his innumerable benefits. This grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

                  <p>Say vnto him; I thanke thee O Lord, for thy incredible clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and thy wonderfull facility in bearing the ſinnes of men; who doeſt dayly ſuſteine me with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular patience euery moment ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt thee, and giues vs all ſpace and time, and meanes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. Euen for this cauſe, O Lord,
<pb n="757" facs="tcp:14934:428"/>thou holdeſt thy peace and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt with vs, that we might giue thee thankes, who gouerneſt and moderateſt the ſaluation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, ſometimes by threatning, &amp; ſometimes by gently exhorting, and who firſt by thy Prophets &amp; after by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of thy Chriſt, haſt viſited vs. For thou haſt made vs, and not we our ſelues: thou art our God alone.</p>
                  <p>But if all prayer muſt begin with thankſgiuing, much more this, in which we would begge ſuch light as might bring vs to the knowledge of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A generall thankſgiuing vnder one name, compriſing all the benefits of GOD, is not very profitable, a ſpeciall, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating all his benefits, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible: for who can recount all his benefits? Therefore a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle courſe is to bee holden, and both certaine generall benefits and ſome particular of that day are to bee called to minde, and
<pb n="758" facs="tcp:14934:429"/>thankes to bee giuen vnto God for them: the remembrance whereof will ſomething diſpoſe vs to ſorrow and repentance. Thus then thou ſhalt ſay. 1. O Lord my God, I giue thee infinit thankes, becauſe thou haſt from all eternity ſeene and loued mee, and (as by thy infinit mercy I hope) haſt effectually elected me to glory, and by conuenient meanes haſt predeſtinated mee thereunto. 2.

2 Thus hauing giuen thanks, thou muſt then aske of GOD, grace to know, diſcuſſe and looke into thy ſelfe: for the heart of man is wicked aboue meaſure and inſearchable; and who doth know it?

                  <p>Therefore thus thou maiſt ſay in thy affection and minde: Thou Oh moſt bountifull! I beſeech thee vnto all theſe thy benefits adde this one more, to ſend mee light from thy glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Throne and giue mee of thy abundant grace, that I may know my manifold ſinnes,

                  <p n="3">3 Wee then come to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of our ſins; which for better vnderſtanding we may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute, into thoughts, affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, words and workes: namely what we are to diſcuſſe in theſe. 3.<note place="margin">Hugo. lib. Med.</note> The affections, cogitations &amp; workes. One ſaith, that in our affections we muſt conſider, that they be right, <hi>i.</hi> that they bee directed vnto that which they ought to be. And ſecondly that they be ſincere, <hi>i.</hi> directed as they ought to be. For to loue that thing which a man ought not to loue is euill; and ſo to loue as a man ought not, is alſo euill. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is a good affection when it is vnto that which it ought to be vnto, and alſo as it ought to be. <hi>Amnon</hi> loued his ſiſter, and it was in affection vnto that which it ſhould be,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 13.</note> but becauſe he loued her wickedly, therefore it was not as it ought to be. Therefore the affection may bee to that
<pb n="763" facs="tcp:14934:431"/>which it ought to be, and yet not as it ought to be. But it can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be as it ought to be, except it be vnto that which it ought to be, in that to which it ought to be, it is a right affection: and how and as it ought to be, it is a ſincere affection. 2. In the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations wee muſt conſider, that they be 1. Cleane, and 2. ordered: they are cleane, when they are neither ingendred of ill affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nor doe engender ill affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. They are ordered, when they come reaſonably, that is, in their owne time. For not in their owne time, euen to thinke good things is not without ſinne as in praier to thinke of reading, and in reading to thinke of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. 3. In workes, we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider. 1. That they be done out of a good intention, a good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is that which is ſimple &amp; right. Simple without malice, right without ignorance. For that which is without malice, hath zeale, but that which is with
<pb n="764" facs="tcp:14934:432"/>ignorance hath not zeale accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to knowledge. Therfore the intention muſt bee right by diſcretion, and ſimple by deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 2. That out of a right in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention begun, they bee with a perſeuerant feruour, brought out to the end; that neither perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance may be ſloathfull, nor loue may wax cold. 3. That they be commanded in the word of God. Elſe God may ſay, who requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red theſe things at your hands? 4. That they proceed from faith, elſe they will prooue to bee no better then birds without fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that cannot flie, and images without life that cannot ſtirre. 5. That they bee done to the glory of God, and the good of our ſelues and others; which is the true and onely end of all our workes. Now for our words; we muſt conſider in them that they be. 1. True. 2. Hurtfull to none. 3. Neceſſary for ſome cauſe. 4. That in fit time and place. 5. In due maner ſpoken, if in any
<pb n="765" facs="tcp:14934:432"/>of theſe wee offend; concerning our thoughts, that they bee leſſe cleane, or leſſe ordered: concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the affections, that they bee leſſe right or leſſe ſincere: concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our workes, that they bee leſſe qualified then we haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; concerning our words; that they be leſſe true or leſſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; wee muſt note it in our memorie that wee may the better conceiue a griefe for it, and procure a purpoſe of amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>In thy examen of thy workes and words, let this be thy forme for the auoyding of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable negligence which in this behalfe is vſed: at ſome conuenient time, bee thou a Iudge of thy ſelfe and take a ſtrict account of thy Steward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: ſaying, Oh euill ſeruant and ſlow, tell mee how thou haſt ſpent this daie? Thou haſt beene ſlow to do thy duetie vnto God: Thou haſt beene indeuout in doing it: Thou haſt ſpoken
<pb n="766" facs="tcp:14934:433"/>many words, with little fruit: thou cameſt late and laboureſt loiteringly. Thou haſt ſpoken vnprofitably, demanded curiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, iudged ſuſpiciouſly, reported diſſolutely, detracted wilfully, thou haſt beene mooued, thou haſt wandred both with thy heart and eyes.

                  <p>From theſe thou maiſt gather a dailie fardle of thy ſinnes, and a heape of ſorrowes for them.

                  <p n="4">4 From this collation &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of Gods benefits and thy ingratitudes and ſinnes; thou wilt deriue ſuch ſorrow and deteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thy ſinnes, that thou ſhalt leaue no place to the ſmalneſſe of faith. Nay euen from this ſame, that thou ſeeſt the ſoule ſoiled with ſo many ſinnes and blemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, and thy moſt mercifull Lord
<pb n="770" facs="tcp:14934:435"/>to beare with thee ſo many yeers, and to haue pardoned thee, not 70 times, ſeauen times, but euen millions of times, thou maiſt be lift vp to hope, that God will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer caſt thee out ſo ſorrowing and greeuing for thy ſinnes, but ſo often as thou ſhalt thus come vnto him and beg pardon, he will redeeme thee as a moſt louing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 At the laſt, ſet ſome paine vpon thy owne head for theſe thy many eſcapes and ſinnes, let it be an amercement proportionable to the quality of thy ſinnes, and ability of thy body, that ſo thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and ſorrow for thy ſins paſt, may bee a barre againſt the propenſitie of ſinning after: check and reproue thy ſelfe againe and againe, and deale as a ſenere and iuſt iudge with thy ſoule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, impriſoning all thy ſences, and fettering thy affections that henceforth they may not ſtealt away thy pretious ſoule from thee.</p>

But to end this point of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion. Whereas I haue often in this treatiſe made mention of this examination, thou maiſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre them all vnto two times; namely before the Communion, and before thou goeſt to bed. For after thou haſt taken a view of thy thoughts, affections, words and actions; turne the eyes of thy minde vnto that vice which thou impugneſt, or that vertue which particularly thou exerciſeſt, and looke diligently, in which thou haſt failed or profited; and ſo ſhalt thou eaſilie twice euery day, fall vpon this profitable exerciſe of diſcuſſing thy ſelfe. From which thou ſhalt gather theſe two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall benefits: firſt thou ſhalt purge thy ſelfe from thy ſinnes by true repentance, and prouoke thy ſelfe to a purpoſe of amendment: ſecondly, thou ſhalt know thy ſelfe within and without euen to a haire; which is the mother of all other graces. For if thou ſhalt ſearch not onely into the boughs
<pb n="772" facs="tcp:14934:436"/>but alſo into the rootes; not into the imperfections, but the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginalls of them, thou ſhalt ſee thy ſelfe plainly to bee full of filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and empty of all goodneſſe, neither ſhalt thou any thing eſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eeme thy ſelfe, but rather euen from the bottome of the heart, deſpiſe the beſt things thou canſt ſee in thy ſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Things to be done, is how to compoſe thy ſelfe to ſleepe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After thou art laide downe in thy bed, recite ſome Pſalme or Prayer, or meditate ſome holy thing. And conſider with thy ſelfe of what moment the grace and loue of God is, vntill that ſleepe came vpon thee. So ſhalt thou be made apt and ſtrong to repell all temptations, and euen in thy ſleepes ſhalt be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt Satan tempting thee; and from the cuſtome of well doing, thou ſhalt feele thy ſelfe ſtirred vp to prayer and all holy deſires. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="773" facs="tcp:14934:436"/>take the deuout mans counſell: when thou goeſt to bed, euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more carry ſomething with thee in thy memory or thought, in which thou maiſt quietly ſleepe, which will alſo ſometimes helpe thee to ſleepe, and which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee waking, may reſtore thee into the ſtate of yeſterdayes intention. So ſhall the night as the day bee alike light vnto thee, thou ſhalt quietly ſleepe, and when thou riſeſt, thou ſhalt bee the more nimble and ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne vnto that which thou did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt not wholy forſake and leaue.</p>
                  <p>If any temptation or paſſion take thee, returne to prayer, and take vnto thee all the complete armor of the Apoſtle: and adde vnto it, the conſideration of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall fire; the torments of the Saints, the conſtancy of Martyrs; the trophees and glories of ſuch as witneſſed a good confeſſion. Conſider diligently the ſtones where with <hi>Stephen</hi> was ſtoned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the broyle yron of <hi>Laurence,</hi> the

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1 Albeit I know the cuſtome of our Church hath otherwiſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the matter; yet if fitlie it might bee done, euery weeke I ſhould thinke it very full of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and profit, if thou diddeſt receiue the holy Communion. For the frequent vſe of receiuing this Sacrament, is of ſo great moment if it be taken not out of cuſtome, but of loue and deuotion, that it would miniſter great helpe to the
<pb n="775" facs="tcp:14934:437"/>aduancement of true pietie. For what ſhall the Sunne of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe doe receiued in the hart, but enlighten the receiuer? what ſhall the fountaine of loue doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in the minde, but comfort the receiuer? what ſhall the true life doe admitted into the boſom of the heart but increaſe the life of the ſoule, and bring it vnto all perfection? a man by much traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique and merchandize often gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth much, but if hee chance to light of ſome pearle of great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, out of doubt he ſhall be much richer. For this may ſuddenly make him a rich man. So a man may grow rich by the practiſe of many vertues; but if he often fall vpon ſuch ineſtimable Pearles as that of the Lords ſupper, where is the true myne of all rich and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Diamonds, how quicklie may he become a Chriſtian of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit worth? For all other vertues giue vs but to ſippe vpon the litle riuers, whereas this giues vs to drinke our fill out of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="776" facs="tcp:14934:438"/>it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Yet great care is to bee taken that wee come well prepared hereunto, leaſt we ſhould eat and drinke our owne damnation. He that comes coldly and of cuſtome gets no benefit by it, but rather much hurt, becauſe he diſcerneth not the Lords body. But if hee come with ſuch deuotion and diſpoſition of heart as becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth a man to doe, to ſo heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a feaſt, he ſhall finde in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the wonderfull effects and power of it, and a maruellous change in his whole life.</p>
                  <p>Herein are two extreames to bee auoided. Firſt of them that would not come ſo often to the Communion; but yet doe come, to auoide the penalty of the Law, or ſuſpition that they are not ſo found as they ſhould be: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of them that would receiue far oftner, (if they might) then other men doe. The firſt of theſe are ſicke either of ſloath or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, becauſe either they neglect
<pb n="777" facs="tcp:14934:438"/>duly to prepare themſelues to the Lords Supper, or out of ſome ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile feare and tenderneſſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, they thinke themſelues not worthy of it. If ſloath and coldneſſe of deuotion be cauſe hereof, then is he to be cured of this coldneſſe, with ſuch things as may inflame him (as before in this Treatiſe) and with conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the greatneſſe of this myſtery and the fruits of it. What good Sonne will neglect to come to his moſt louing Father? what brother will refuſe to come to his elder brother on whom he wholy depends? what wiſe doth not willingly entertaine her louing husband? and why ſhould any flie from the entertainement of the author of his iuſtification, ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and remiſſion of his ſins, and the giuer of all graces? In this banquet, is the ſweetneſſe of the ſoule, and the fruit of all vertues; Here ſhall hee eat the bread that comforts mans heart, heere ſhall he taſte the hony that is ſweete
<pb n="778" facs="tcp:14934:439"/>vnto his throat, here ſhall hee drinke his wine and milke. For he that eates ſhall eat to ſatiety, and he that drinkes, ſhall haue riuers of the water of life ſlowe out of his belly.</p>
                  <p>What and how great profit is in this feaſt, where ſinnes are cleanſed, vices extinguiſhed, paſſions doe acquire a meaſure, vertues an increaſe, and heauenly gifts their perfections? how great is the ſweetneſſe of this table, where is water cooling, wine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ebriating, milke refreſhing him, hony ſweetning, and the bread of life eternizing? Deſire euermore to be partaker of the grace of it: and if thou doeſt feele no hunger of it, know thou art ſicke, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to be cured.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe other that deſire to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate oftner then others, let them take heede it proceede not from emulation, becauſe others doe often receiue it, and they would gladly be accounted de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout, let them cheeke themſelues
<pb n="779" facs="tcp:14934:439"/>of too much pride and hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie: and if it proceed of ſome ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible deuotion which they thinke is to be receiued by vſing it, let them mortifie themſelues and know that not ſenſible deuotion but the purity of the ſoule, is to be ſought as the chiefe end in this Sacrament: but if it proceede from an impatient deſire, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent loue, that contents not it ſelfe in any but in the Lord; if there be purity of life, the gift of prayer, an euident profit by the Communion, the edification of others, and no ſcandall giuen to others; which doe perſwade vs that theſe deſires proceede from God, he may then very well vſe it more often, ſo that hee liue in ſuch ſort as he may be an example to others. But howſoeuer either of theſe ſorts receiue it, let them euer haue that of <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> in minde: whom ſhal we make moſt account of? thoſe who once, or thoſe who often, or thoſe who ſeldome receiue it? neither thoſe
<pb n="780" facs="tcp:14934:440"/>who once, nor thoſe who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, nor thoſe who ſeldome, but thoſe that take it with a cleane heart, a cleane conſcience, and a life vnreproueable.</p>
                  <p>Now there are two ſorts of diſpoſition and preparation to bee vſed in receiuing the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The firſt is, as it were a farre off, and that is no other but a holy life, free from vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, diſtractions and foule crimes which doe defile a man and make him odious in GODS ſight. For the more humble in heart, pure in minde, feruent in loue, and holy in life thou art, the more worthily ſhalt thou receiue this Sacrament.<note place="margin">2. Tim. 2.</note> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are wee aduiſed to clenſe our ſelues from all ſinnes that we may bee veſſels ſanctified vnto honour and ready vnto euery good worke: our liues muſt bee euer ſo holy, as that with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and profit wee may receiue the Sacrament euery day if neede were.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="781" facs="tcp:14934:440"/>
The other kinde of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is to bee performed, for a weeke or ſome ſuch fit time before our receiuing of it; in which time a full ſuruey with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out partiality, beeing taken of a mans life, wee may ſo giue our ſelues to Prayer, Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Repentance and other Holy duties, that wee ridde from vs the burden of our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing ſinnes; and bee furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Faith, Hope, Loue and all the troupe of ſauing gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to the ende wee may in ſome competent meaſure ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach that Heauenly banquet.</p>
                  <p>And to conclude, with the ſame or more diligence which when thou ſeeſt a woman painte and trimme her ſelfe that: ſhee may appeare to bee beautifull to men, muſt thou deeke, waſh, purifie and painte thy ſelfe and thy Soule with inward graces, that thou maiſt bee truely beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull in the eyes of thy louing God.</p>

                     <pb n="782" facs="tcp:14934:441"/>
And if after thou haſt liued a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life, and for ſome time before the communion alſo prepared thy ſelfe, and that day wherein thou receiuedſt the communion exerciſed thy ſelfe in repentance and holy deſires and ſhalt for all this find no ſenſible deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but rather a drynes, yet caſt not down thy ſelfe, nor withdraw thy ſelfe from the Sacrament: for the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God worketh diuerſly in thoſe that ſerue him the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of his graces; nor muſt any man ſearch out the ſecrets of God, for they are vnſearchable and paſt finding out. Therefore the indeuoute ought not to bee driuen from the Sacrament, whilſt hee liues holily, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth himſelfe humbly, and comes reuerently: nay whilſt hee tells me, hee is ſory for his ſinnes, and purpoſeth amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and craues the helpe of that bleſſed Sacrament, he is not to be kept from it. For it is the hid Manna and conteines abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
<pb n="783" facs="tcp:14934:441"/>of all ſpirituall delights.</p>
                  <p>Now for ſome good time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the receiuing of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion thou ſhalt doe well to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect thy ſelfe to giue thankes for ſo great a benefit: for not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the defect of preparation, but euen the defect of giuing of thankes may much hinder the fruite thereof. For ſhall we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue all thoſe infinit benefits of his paſſion, and paſſe by him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaluted? He comes to heare our petitions and helpe our miſeries and ſhall wee aske nothing of him? He enters moſt louingly into the Inner chamber of our hearts and ſhall we giue him no thankes? Leaſt wee fall into ſo great ingratitude, and looſe ſuch an opportunity of profiting, ſit like good <hi>Magdalene,</hi> at the feete of thy Lord and Sauiour. Heare diligently his word, hee will vouchſafe to teach thee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſpeake to him, be confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at thy owne vility and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, and begge pardon for
<pb n="784" facs="tcp:14934:442"/>thy ſmall and remiſſe diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; offer vp to him thy body, and all that belongs vnto thee, a holy, lyuing and acceptable Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, lay open thy miſeries and neceſſities, deſire his grace and all the good meanes that may further thee thereunto, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe thy ſelfe in all the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of loue. If thus thou ſhalt doe, the Lord will not ſuffer thee to depart from his preſence, without a bleſſing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>Things to bee done euery weeke is the hearing the word preached.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THis is very neceſſary to bee heard (at the leaſt) once a weeke; for as it is the true and onely meanes in that kinde to heale our ſpirituall leproſies, ſo is it to conſerue and keepe vs in ſanctitie of life, and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all health.

                  <p>If then thou wilt profit by hearing, come prepared as in the firſt part of this treatiſe thou art taught. Come with preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, praier and great deſire to learne. Heare not negligently and for faſhion, but let the words of wiſdome ſinke into thy heart.

                  <p>And thou ſhalt ſtirre vp this holy deſire much, if thou ſhalt obſerue well that thou ſtandeſt

Thou muſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde whether the Preacher bee learned, or eloquent, or to thy toothe, for if hee bring the word of GOD vnto thee, thou oughteſt to heare him with like reuerence, as if hee were endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with great talents and guifts. For as it falls out in the affaires of men,<note place="margin">Chryſ.</note> when the King ſends his Letters, happily by ſome baſe poſte, or man of no rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning, and ſuch as cannot rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon vp any petigree of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,

So the hearer muſt not haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reſpect to the meanes of his condition or condition of his guifts whom GOD will imploy in his ſeruice, to bring him the tidings of ſaluation: but with all reuerence and attention muſt receiue the meſſage brough, as if it were deliuered him by the king of Heauen himſelfe. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe wee faile herein, it cauſeth the word to haue ſuch ſmall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in our hearts.

                  <p>Nor yet muſt wee regard, if the Preacher doe often propoſe vnto vs common doctrines and knowne to all men: for thou
<pb n="789" facs="tcp:14934:444"/>muſt not heare the doctrine of the ſpirit, to learne new, things, but that thou maiſt bee ſtirred to practiſe the olde things thou haſt already learned, and that thou maiſt bee aſhamed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, that thou haſt not performed the good things thou knoweſt. For if the worde of GOD had not come vnto thee, thou had'ſt had no ſinne, but now thou haſt no excuſe for thy ſinne. Therefore heare the Worde of GOD, not with loathſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and tediouſneſſe, but atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely and deſirouſly, not out of curioſity, but out of a deſire to learne and practiſe the good things thou heareſt.</p>

The hearer of the word, ſaith a Father, muſt be like to thoſe beaſts, which becauſe they chew the cudde are called cleane, that it may not be irkſome vnto him to thinke on the things which he receiued into the womb of his heart: and when he heares, let him be like to one that eates; but when he calls things hard to remembrance, let him be like one that chewes the cudde. If ſo thou heareſt the word, thou art happy: Bleſſed are they that heare the word of God and keepe it. Heare humbly, not as a cenſor to iudge, but as a ſcholler to learne: Heare attentiuely, that thou maiſt keep in memory what thou heareſt, heare faithfully, that as good ground thou maiſt bring foorth fruit, through the ſeed that hath been ſowne in thee, and ſo from abundance of doctrine, thou ſhalt gather a moſt rich ſtore-houſe of al vertues and graces.

The Philoſophers haue determined that a naturall motion is very flow at the beginning, but ſwift at the end, but a violent motion is ſwift at the beginning and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſlow at the end. As for the purpoſe, if a great and weighty thing ſhould naturally deſcend downewards, it would ſlowly begin to fall downe wards: but the nerer it came to the center, the more ſwiftly it would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the center, that it might

But if a ſtone were violently throwne vp into the ayer, it would beginne to aſcend with great celerity, but after a while, it would begin to ſlacke his courſe, and grow, as it were, fainte and weary. Hence may we euidently gather the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of renewing our ſpirits.

Euer giue him thanks: for it is iuſt, that re ceiuing euery moment benefits, thou ſhouldeſt anſwer him euery moment if it were poſſible infinit thankes. There is no moment, wherein thou receiueſt not from God, being, life, ſenſe, vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and all other good things naturall and ſupernaturall in thee or about thee: if therefore when thou receiueſt a benefit from man by and by thou thankeſt him; ſhalt thou not be moſt ingrate to God, in receiuing ſo many bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings and giuing ſo few thankes?

<pb n="813" facs="tcp:14934:456"/>what ſeemeth beſt in his eyes. Say often, thy will bee done, but with all imbrace his will in thy will. For wee often ſay with the mouth, and reſiſt it with our deſire and purpoſe; wee offer it him in word, but wee reteine it indeede; Wee giue it him in ſpeech, but in action we fooliſhly reſiſt GOD when hee would take his owne. Doe not thou ſo: but know that thou art not thy owne but GODS; thine are not thine, but GODS: Therefore thou medleſt with another mans gods againſt his will, and ſo in the day of iudgement ſhalbe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned of theft. Bee thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord as a table cleane wherein nothing is written, that hee may write in thee what hee pleaſeth. Be as the clay in the hand of the potter, that hee may breake thee or make thee, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made, may ſet thee in a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or lower place. Looke vpon all thou haſt, thy Life, Health,

Hee loues thee infinitly more then thou doſt thy ſelfe; therefore thou oughteſt to put thy ſelfe into his hands, to doe with thee both now and in all eternity, what he pleaſeth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Our duety towards our brethren. Where conſider 1. In thy brother thou muſt regarde to thinke and behold not ſo much man as God: for God is in euery thing by his eſſence, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and power, but chiefely and in an excellent manner in man. Therefore it is fit that in euery thing, but eſpecially in man, we behold God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when thou ſeeſt or ſpeakeſt with thy brother thou ſhouldeſt not ſo much behold his aſpect with the eyes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>unde. To obtaine this;
<pb n="815" facs="tcp:14934:457"/>is a great guift of God. For ſo ſhalt thou not be affected either to his youth or beauty, or abhor the aged, lame and ſicke, and ſhalt obtaine a wonderfull puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of minde and a ſingular fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity with God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The loue of our brethren. Loue thy neighbour as thy ſelfe, is the precept: and is like that great commandement of the loue of God: for it commaunds loue; and commands it for Gods ſake, and in his amplitude in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes all the commandements for he that loues his neighbour hath fulfilled the Law. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore loue thy neighbour with true and pure loue,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.8</note> not for gaine, nor for any created thing, but onely for thy God. This thou ſhalt doe, if thou ſhalt not conteinue thy brethren in thy heart, if thou ſhalt not iudge them raſhly, if thou ſhalt not brawle with them, if neither in word or deed thou ſhalt harme them, if according to thy ability thou helpe them.
<pb n="816" facs="tcp:14934:458"/>To conclud, if thou perform that is written; not to do vnto another what thou wouldeſt not haue done to thy felfe. Nor is this loue difficult, if thou doſt contemplate God in thy brother, if thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membreſt that hee is holden in high eſteeme with God; if thou ſhalt think that he is the ſonne of God, ordained vnto glory, and vnto thee profitable.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Affability to all men, and good example. Acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modate thy ſelfe to all men: ſpeake gently to all: let no in-urbanity or in-ciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or ruſticity appeare in thee to offend any. A ſweet talke mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplieth friends, &amp; pacifieth them that bee at variance; a ſweete tongue increaſeth much good talke.<note place="margin">Syr. 6.</note> Therefore ſo conuerſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all men, that all may loue thee, and euery one deſire thy company.</p>
                  <p>To all men giue good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſpread abroad the ſauour of ſanctity, and being made the good ſauour of Chriſt in euery
<pb n="817" facs="tcp:14934:458"/>place, thou maiſt not only praiſe him with thy owne mouth, but with all mens mouthes. For thou doſt praiſe him euen with the mouth and heart of others, whom by the purity of thy life thou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiteſt to praiſe him. This thou ſhalt doe, if in the good workes thou ſheweſt, and circumſpection thou keepeſt, thou ſeeke not thy owne, but the praiſe and glory of GOD. Therefore do nothing whereby others may take any ſcandall or offence, or occaſion of liuing at more liberty.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Honor of our brethren. Go one before another in giuing ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor. It is pride to expect from others the ſignes of honor, and not rather to preuene them in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing honor. Shew thy humility in honoring others, not in hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting after honor: Let none paſſe by thee without honor, let none come to thee without honor. Yea euen thou ſhalt honor God dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in men, when thou giueſt due honor to euery man accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="818" facs="tcp:14934:459"/>to his place.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. One to beare anothers bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then. Our defects are great bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, by which we ſometimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come intollerable to others. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the defects &amp; churliſh man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of our brethren muſt be born withall, that ſo we may fulfill the Law of charity. Meaſure others by thy ſelfe: I know thou ſeeft in thy owne conuerſation many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, which thou wouldeſt haue other men to beare. So muſt thou doe with others, except thou wilt with diuerſe weights and diuerſe meaſures, meaſures o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens and thy owne, which is abhominable. Therefore beare, that thou maiſt bee born with all, diſſemble others light defects, that thy great ones may be diſſembled, be thou ſilent, that thy miſcries may be ſilenced.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 Helpe one another. Bee profitable to all and by thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry helpe them for the loue of God. Helpe by thy Prayers, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring Gods mercy for them?
<pb n="819" facs="tcp:14934:459"/>Helpe with holy deſires, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the fruite of their labours with the Lord, be they corporall or ſpirituall: helpe with thy ſpeech when thy wiſdome find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth opportunity exhorting to all things fitting and honeſt: helpe by thy example of life; and helpe by all the meanes which GOD hath giuen thee. For to this end haſt thou receiued them to bee Gods Steward.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 Liue circumſpectly. Loue all, but be familiar only with the godly. For he that toucheth pitch ſhalbe defiled with it,<note place="margin">Syr. 13.</note> and he that is familiar with the proud will be like vnto him. Nor be too famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar with any, for out of doubt it ſpends and conſumes the time, diſtracts the heart, and makes two men offend at once.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Our duty towards our ſelues, where conſider. 1. The care of modeſty. In all thy acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be mindefull of modeſty, and ſo behaue thy ſelfe that thou no leſſe reſpect thy ſelfe, then others
<pb n="820" facs="tcp:14934:460"/>beholding thee. Modeſty is not onely a vertue, but the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all vertues. It it that which with men gaines eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: becauſe by the aſpect of the face, and thoſe things which they ſee outwardly, they are wont to meaſure our inward parts. And as it is a Iudge of inward ſereni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and faireneſſe, ſo is it wont to keepe the ſame amongſt all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of trouble. Therefore thou ſhalt ſhew thy ſelfe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, as well in the cleereneſſe of thy countenance, as grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of thy gate, and in the moderation of all outward acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; ſo that theſe outward things may ſhew the inward tranquillity, to edifie all; and may ſhew ſome image as it were of Chriſt whoſe modeſty was ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, that <hi>Paul</hi> beſought the <hi>Corinthians</hi> by the meekeneſſe &amp; gentleneſſe of Chriſt.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 10.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 The contempt of ones ſelfe. Learne to diſcuſſe thy ſelfe, to Iudge, blame, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne
<pb n="825" facs="tcp:14934:460"/>thy ſelf. It is a knowledge more profitable to know to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe ones ſelfe, then to know the amplitude of heauen and earth. This Science of the knowledge of our ſelues doth euer caſt in wholeſome and profitable coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailes, tending to the humble de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing of our ſelues. Therefore turne thy eies from thoſe things which thou thinkeſt are good and excellent in thy ſelfe, for they are not thine but Gods, who gaue them gratis without thy deſert; and behold in thy ſelfe the things that are abiect and deſpicable, for theſe are thy owne proceeding from thy cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature; and for theſe argue and deſpiſe thy ſelfe: Let thy words ſauour of the contempt of thy ſelfe: and deſire to heare the ſame from others, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thee, and let not the baulme of flattery breake thy heade. Flee applauſes, flee the world; and hearken to ſuch wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, who ſincerely ſpeake
<pb n="822" facs="tcp:14934:461"/>truth and doe reprehend in thee what is worthy of reproofe. If thou ſhalt thus contemne thy ſelfe and loue thy contemners, God ſhall loue thee as the apple of his eye, and ſhall adorne thee with great bleſſings of the ſpirit: for this holy hatred wherewith one hates himſelfe, God doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly recompence with his loue.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 A generall abnegation of our ſelues. This is Chriſts rule: <hi>If any will bee my Diſciple,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Math. 16.24.</note> 
                     <hi>let him deny himſelfe take vp the Croſſe and follow mee.</hi> This word (himſelfe) doth not deſigne one part of the man, but the whole man to bee denied.

Chiefely bridle the two tongues of body and ſoule; the tongue of the body, that it ſpeake not hurtfull and vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="823" facs="tcp:14934:461"/>things. The tongue of the ſoule, that is thy thought, that it doe not harbour and vtter vaine impure, vnfruitful things: if thou ſhalt tame theſe two beaſts, the tongue of thy ſelfe and thy co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation, thou ſhalt wonderfully diſpoſe thy ſelfe to the familiarity of God. For God vouchſafeth to ſpeake to them, whom he ſees abſteine from vaine words, and as much as they can, doe recall their thoughts to one, that is to God himſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 To beate downe the body. This rebell fleſh is euer in armes againſt the ſpirit: Therefore that it may not ouercome, let the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit take armes againſt the fleſh &amp; by watching, faſting, prayer, and ſuch holy helpes, labour to bring it in ſubiection. Beaſts are not perſwaded with reaſons or argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to obey men. The fleſh is a beaſt, which thou ſhalt neuer tame by conſideration alone, without ſome caſtigation, or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of food, as men vſe to

                  <p n="5">5 Tranquillity of heart. Thinke thou haſt done nothing, vntill thou haſt obtained this. Let not thy owne defects diſquiet thee; but preſently aſſoone as thou falleſt into any ſinne, out of the loue of God, deteſt it, returne to peace, and commit thy ſelfe and all thine to Chriſt. Let not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities trouble thee, think they will not tarry, nor that they came without the good wil and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God. The tranquillity of the heart depends vpon the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it. For ſmall ſinnes teare the heart, but for inordinate affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s excruciate &amp; torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t it. Prophane buſineſſe doe gripe the heart, and ſuch as belong not to our calling infect it. If therefore thou wilt haue a quiet heart, ſhunne euen the leaſt ſinnes, thoſe thou ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt not, preſently repent thee of them, moderate thy affections, flee prophane buſineſſe and withdraw thy ſelfe from all that belongs not to thy calling.</p>

6 Is diſcretion. In theſe things hitherto treated of, and in all others, there is great neede of diſcretion, whereby thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt conſider, the times, places, the perſons, thy ſelfe, and ſuch with whom thou dealeſt, thy ſtate and manner of conuerſation, and according as reaſon, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and the qualities of things &amp; perſons, ſhall dictate &amp; direct thee, ſo thou ſhouldeſt carry thy ſelf in things that do occur &amp; of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues. Many things there are which do diſpleaſe God, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thy neighbour, &amp; hurt thy ſelf, becauſe not ſeaſoned with the ſalt of diſcretion: the ſame things if they were diſcreetely don, would be of great acceptance both with God and man: but the diſcretion which thou haſt not, let it be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with prayer &amp; recourſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God &amp; with the counſailes of prudent and wiſe men. For hee that in doubtfull thing reſorts to GOD and the counſailes of the wiſe ſhall neuer erre.

               <p>IF ſhall be obiected, that this manner of ſeruing of God is moſt troubleſome and withall moſt impoſſible in repect of our many frailties, miſeries, and alſo our neceſſary and alloweable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments in our vocations: I anſwere that hauing fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted our ſelues with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall rules and inſtructions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined in this booke, the greateſt part of bodily labour in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God will eaſily be cut off, and we ſhall lay for a foundation that of the Apoſtles, that bodily exerciſe profiting but little,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4.</note> our chiefe care muſt be to reuerence and loue God in our mindes, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cogitations, and good deſires,
<pb n="828" facs="tcp:14934:464"/>albeit yet thoſe duties of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies may not as time and place will giue leaue, be vtterly neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected. For it is godlineſſe onely that is profitable vnto all things.</p>
               <p>But beſides, ſeeing we are to giue an account vnto God for the expence of our times, as the moſt pretious guift of God; it is very neceſſary, that euery man haue a knowledge of ſome profitable forme of ſeruing GOD, that hee may thereby labour ſo to ſpend the foure and twenty houres of the day, and ſo conſequently all the daies of his life: that he may aſſure his owne conſcience, this his life hath beene life indeed and not death, and ſo may obtaine the glory of eternall life, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide eternall death in which all they doe euer die that liue in theſe inſinit ſtreights of the world, and doe not make vſe of their moſt deare and pretious time, to that end for which it was leut them, namely to know, loue, feare and reuerence God, &amp;
<pb n="829" facs="tcp:14934:464"/>to delight onely in him and the things directed vnto him.</p>
               <p>Therefore experience teacheth vs that there are three conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which do not only inuit, but ought alſo to enforce euery man but eſpecially great perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, (who thinke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues moſt exe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this kind of ſeruing God) duly &amp; in ſuch a ſtreight &amp; exact manner as this is, to ſerue God. The 1. is the nobility, of him which ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth. The 2. is his greatneſſe and goodnes who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſerue. The 3. is hope of reward. Theſe 3. if we do rightly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther motiues very effectuall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, wil caſily ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that we ſhal neuer omit to ſerue the high God in this ſort.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The nobility of him that ſerueth ought to mooue him to ſerue well. For a generous minde in ſome ſort compels a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous man to perform the taske he hath vndertake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, after the moſt ſublime &amp; excellent maner that poſſibly he can, &amp; that eſpecially
<pb n="830" facs="tcp:14934:465"/>when he hath to doe with great noble and generous perſons. Therefore euery man (as much as is belonging to this buſineſſe) muſt conſider what himſelfe is &amp; of how great nobility and worth: And thus doing, wee ſhall finde our ſelues to bee of much more excellency then the heauens, nay the whole frame of the world; ſeeing wee are created after the image and ſimilitude of God, and are his Sonnes, if wee ſerue him a right, and ſhalbe heires of his eternall Kingdome. This nobility of ours ought much to incite vs rightly and duly to ſerue God.</p>
               <p>For albeit we may omit, that it is iuſt, that the generous ſhould vſe his generoſity, through his fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity to ſerue duly; nothing elſe doth ſo much effect, that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous &amp; noble perſons may come nere to that moſt high and true nobility which they wiſh, as to ſerue the moſt high God. For thus,<note place="margin">Pſal. 82.1.</note> of men, they become Gods, and ſo become farre more noble,

If the Sonne doe make vs free then are wee free indeede:<note place="margin">Io. 8.36.</note> if hee inoble vs then are wee truely inobled.</p>
               <p>And ſurely this is not without great reaſon:<note place="margin">Matth. 24.47.</note> for onely thoſe ſhall be kings of heauen and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers ouer all their Maſters goods.

But al thoſe that ſerue not Chriſt, are not onely the ſonnes of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, but euen at length are made his moſt vile ſlaues in eternall darkeneſſe. Therefore if there be any whom the former cauſe, namely, that he may obtaine moſt excellent liberty dominion and nobility doth not inuite to ſerue God, ſurely that man ought to be
<pb n="832" facs="tcp:14934:466"/>terrified with the great euill which in the ſecond place is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, namely that ſo hee becomes the ſonne and ſlaue of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, and for this cauſe ſhould ſtriue with al his powers to ſerue God.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Wee muſt alſo ponder the greatneſſe and dominion and the bounty &amp; goodneſſe of him, for whoſe ſeruice we were created. And we ſhall finde that the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion which God hath ouer e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one of vs, &amp; alſo ouer all the Kings and great Potentates and States both in heauen and earth, is without al compariſon greater, then the dominion that all the Kings &amp; great ones of the world hath aboue one baſe basket of earth: nor are they indeed the true Lords of ſo much: but God is ſo the Lord of all them, that with one only blaſt he can turne them vnto nothing, and plunge them all into the deepe dungeon of hell; except they ſhall ſerue him: but if they will ſerue him,
<pb n="833" facs="tcp:14934:466"/>he ſhall ſo exalt them in another life, that they ſhall truely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that whatſoeuer they poſſeſſed here, was nothing elſe, but a baſe basket of earth, compared vnto thoſe worthy things which there they ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy.</p>
               <p>There is no cauſe that wee ſhould in many words extoll the greatneſſe of this Lord: for albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it wee ſhould neuer ceaſe, yet ſhould it be nothing that we had ſaid in reſpect of that which the thing is. And I am reſolued to diſpatch theſe things in few words that they may make the better impreſſion in our memories: Therefore it is moſt iuſt that wee ſhould ſerue ſo Great a LORD, in reſpect of whom all creatures in heauen and earth are of ſo ſmall eſteeme as a droppe of water to the Ocean.</p>
               <p>Nor ſhall his goodneſſe (me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinkes) leſſe inuite vs, which we ought in euery moment of our
<pb n="834" facs="tcp:14934:467"/>liues a thouſand times to recount. Surely, amongſt the abiect men of the world, it would bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for a great fauor, if ſome King, or great Lord ſhould for their loue, inuite them vnto him, by rewards, when for ſome foule Treaſon committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their ſaid King or Lord, hee might iuſtly take a ſeuere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, of them. Yet ſhould his bounty and goodneſſe appeare to be greater, if for ſuch Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, ſuch a Lord ſhould expoſe himſelfe to many afflictions and death it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>But yet aboue all theſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all compariſon, doth the goodneſſe of GOD ſhine to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs. For being of ſo great Maieſty and ſtanding neede of nothing, yet he chooſe to leade a life of ſo great labours and ſorrowes, vntill by moſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell torments hee laide it downe, that hee might giue life vnto them that were worthy of death: and that hee might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich
<pb n="835" facs="tcp:14934:467"/>them with more ſublime life and eternall riches which were ſuch ingrate Traytors vnto him.</p>
               <p>This Great GOD of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit goodneſſe, beſides the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits wee haue ſpoken of, hath alſo commanded his Angels con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to ſerue and guarde vs: Hee hath commaunded that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth ſhould not for a moment of time ceaſe from our ſeruice. And beſides all theſe, that hee might ſhew his exceeding goodneſſe the more aboundantly, hee hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to bee with vs to the ende of the world. Hee procures by innumerable meanes, that wee ſhould increaſe in all true good: nor doth hee at any time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent that thoſe which ſerue him, ſhall bee afflicted, but vnder condition, that by the ſame, there may much good come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: for hee more deſireth our good, then wee out ſelues. But indeed I aske, what will
<pb n="836" facs="tcp:14934:468"/>hee not doe for our good, who was contented for vs, with ſo great afflictions to deliuer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vnto death? Surely what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer can herein be ſpoken, is nothing to him that ſhall atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely conſider theſe things.</p>
               <p n="3">3 I alſo ſaid, that, to the end we might be the more animated to ſerue this ſo Great and good a LORD, wee ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the greatneſſe of rewards, wee expect, if we doe ſerue him: and ſeeing they are ſo great that the whole world ſufficeth not to expreſſe or conceiue them;<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.9.</note> let it ſuffice for this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent conſideration; that it were a farre more ſorrowfull meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, if it were ſhewed but to the leaſt of them that liue in Heauen; that GOD had determined to take him thence and to make him King of the whole Worlde; then if it were ſhewed to ſome King of the Earth, that GOD would the next day depriue him of his
<pb n="837" facs="tcp:14934:468"/>Kingdome, and ſuffer him for to be thruſt thorow with his own Subiects ſpeares. This is ſo true, and neede ſo little proofe, that no man doubteh of it, but hee that Iudgeth ill of all Truth.</p>
               <p>And ſurely, if hee who ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth GOD ſhould not expect theſe great and excellent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in Heauen, but onely peace, full of the ioy of the heart, which they doe poſſeſſe in this life that giue themſelues to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, and the contempt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection of the vanities of this world: and that they might bee freed from the miſerable and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer contented or quieted life which they liue that liue in ſinne; euen that onely ought to ſuffice hereunto that our whole life ſhould bee dedicated to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of this Great GOD, how much more, whileſt wee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſo great and excellent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, euen ſuch as no man can expreſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="838" facs="tcp:14934:469"/>
Therefore he that conſidereth theſe things, and is not ſtirred vp and animated to ſerue God, let him certainely know, that hee is benummed with the ſleepe of death: yet let him not omit to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour that hee may be ſtirred vp, for God is readie to giue remedie to our diſeaſes, if with humilitie we doe as much as in vs lieth.</p>
               <p>But if anie bee not ſtirred vp with theſe things; it is good for him to ſearch in himſelfe, and to get ſome remedie, if happily hee be obnoxious to ſome ſecret ſin, of which he hath had no remorſe of conſcience: which if he finde, let him miniſter a remedy by true amendment and repentance, and hee ſhall by and by feele health and ſtrength to doe all that is good: and this ſweete ſinne may be called inordinate loue, which begetteth ſome inflation and ſwelling in the ſoule. And hence it is that God often forſakes vs, and giues no remedie to our dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, till we finde out and amend
<pb n="839" facs="tcp:14934:469"/>that ſecret fault; for wee muſt not onelie ſerue GOD in ſome things which he commaunds, but in all: nor muſt we deſire to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand in his ſeruice, that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie which is pleaſant, or not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry grieuous, but euen that which for our pride and malice ſhall be very laborious: therefore let all men bee mooued by theſe three conſiderations, to acknowledge that they ought to ſerue this God euen in the higheſt and ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteſt courſe that is heere pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>
